We will consider painting and sculpture alongside other media in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas, arranged chronologically in order to provide a more integrated historical context for their production. The course objectives include: broad understanding of art making processes and the historical/social/artistic context of objects; knowledge of significant art historical moments and influences; concepts and vocabulary to analyze and discuss visual material. The course is designed for those students with little or no background in art history as well as for those contemplating a major in Art History and Visual Culture or in studio art.

Born of experiments in art and science, the medium combines vision and technology. It possesses a uniquely intimate relation to the real and for this reason has many applications outside the realm of fine art; nevertheless, from its inception photography has been a vehicle for artistic aspirations. This survey of the history of photography from its earliest manifestations to the 2000s considers the medium's applications - as art, science, historical record, and document. This course is open to all students and is the prerequisite for most other courses in the history of photography. (Art History distribution: 1800-Present) ",

Covering many aspects of architecture from buildings, drawings, models, exhibitions, and schools, to historical and theoretical writings and manifestoes we will investigate a range of modernist practices, polemics, and institutions. The readings, both primary and secondary texts, have been selected both to provide an overview of the history of modern architecture and to offer a number of critical and historical approaches to evaluating its legacy.

Is alchemy a scientific pursuit or a religious or spiritual one? This Big Ideas course provides a multifaceted exploration of the history of alchemy in thought, practice and art. Isaac Newton, an active alchemist, translated the Latin text that set out his own basic conviction: \"That which is below is like that which is above & that which is above is like that which is below.\" Alchemy asserts that all elements and forces of the universe are related, and that human beings are capable of understanding and influencing their relationship to one another. One result was the now famous quest to turn ordinary metals into gold. But alchemy during the several thousand years of its history has been applied in many different ways. It has embraced fundamental philosophical currents, contributing distinctive worldviews that remain current in global culture. Alchemy has always been intimately related to artistic practice and this class will provide a survey of works pertaining to alchemical processes ranging from medieval manuscripts to the modern era, from Surrealism to the latest contemporary art. There will be a number of film screenings and guest lectures associated with the course, i.e. from the History of Science, a modern-day practitioner of alchemy, contemporary artists, and others.

Rigorous movement that generates heat, energy, and solidarity will be the daily starting point for a class that culminates in collaborative dancemaking. Weekly readings, performance viewings, and reflective writing assignments will share the many ways that people from diverse cultures have employed dance as a liberatory practice that fosters communal empowerment and joy. Dancers of all levels are welcome to enroll; all levels will be challenged. No prior dance experience necessary. If you have questions, please email lcox@bard.edu. Class size: 25",

Students will learn how the advent of sound impacted the development of narrative film aesthetics in both popular and art cinema traditions. Classical Hollywood cinema will play a major role in our discussions as an industrial and aesthetic system, as well as a hegemonic force that both threatened and inspired various international efforts toward independent filmmaking. Moving into the 1960s, we will focus especially on cinematic \"New Waves,\" comparing film movements in countries that may include France, Japan, the Czech Republic, and Brazil, and paying special attention to how both national culture and international exchange affected film aesthetics. We will also explore the politically and aesthetically radical interventions of both experimental and documentary filmmakers. Readings will offer narrative overviews of the major developments in film history, as well as historically important theoretical texts by authors such as Andr\u00e9 Bazin, Laura Mulvey, James Baldwin, Susan Sontag, and others.",

We will also pay attention to the strong graphic/collage cinema of artists like Cornell, Conner, Smith, and Breer as well as to the anarchic, comic improvisations of figures like Jacobs, Kuchar, and MacLaine. We will end in the mid 1970's by touching on the movement's then future prospects, e.g. the revitalization of storytelling through autobiography (Mekas) and feminist/critical narrative (Rainer). Supplementary readings, including many theoretical works by the filmmakers themselves as well as material touching on parallel avant-garde movements in painting, photography, poetry, and music from the same era, works by highly influential artists like Charles Olson, John Cage, et al.

        "description": "Perhaps the most enduring figure in the history of cinema, the vampire as a character and cinematic trope, is reinvented and revised with each era as a means to address prevalent fears and desires and as a marker of social change. A mutable in-between creature, with narratives originating from traditional folklore, gothic lore, teen drama and camp, the vampire offers specific lessons regarding genre, character and style, in addition to a critical analysis of feminism, race, spirituality, genetics and otherness. This is a production class in which students will compose short videos in response to assigned texts, locations and film fragments during the first half of the semester, and produce an ambitious final project during the second half. We will screen and discuss recent and historical films by Jarmusch, Amirpour, Rollin, Dreyer and Portabella plus films from the vaults of Universal Pictures, Hammer Films and the Shaw Brothers. Requirements include: participation in discussions, completion of all assignments, participation on production teams and a successful final project. A class for film-majors and non-majors with proven cinema skills. Class size: 12",

It begins as histories of expressions by African descendants in the New World, as well as how their sounds and social positions have both attracted and resisted the participation of allies and oppressors in the construction of jazz as American culture. Histories such as these foreground assertions of jazz as both an American sound and the sound of something broader. The various lifeworlds of jazz\u2014local and global, past and present\u2014lead to questions about the music\u2019s folk, popular, and art music categorization. Through a framework of exploring the history of jazz through specific sounds and surrogate communications, this course surveys the development of musical aesthetics set within specific social contexts that reveal how improvisation wields the production and reception of sounds and communications within and beyond the bandstand. Students in the survey course will read, present, and discuss writing about jazz and its periods. Lectures will situate specific media examples of performances across folk, popular, and art contexts, in ways that also foreground the significance of individual and group agency. Examples of race, gender, class, nationality, generation, and their intersections in jazz music will be the focus of the final research paper assignment. Class size: 20",

        "description": "Nineteen-sixty-eight was a year of world-wide student protests, wars and assassinations. It was also a banner year in music, in classical, jazz and rock alike. By focusing on a single year (allowing for a few side glances a couple of years ahead and back), we will attempt a time travel fifty years into the past, and place the music in a broad historical, political and artistic context. Ranging from Stockhausen and Ligeti to the Beatles and Rolling Stones and beyond, the class will seek to transcend conventional boundaries of genre. There will be a number of reading and listening assignments the whole class will be required to complete, but students will be expected to identify and pursue individual areas of interest for term papers and class presentations.

And yet, its premise- that human attention is riveted when a unified impression is created via maximum variety- is a fertile psychological principle relevant to many fields. Overall, this course will follow classical species counterpoint as outlined by the eminent Knud Jeppesen, based on the style of Palestrina. However, we will also examine the freer styles of earlier composers such as Josquin and Ockeghem, and generalize from contrapuntal concepts to such derivatives as the dissonant counterpoint of Charles Seeger and others. The ability to read music, and basic knowledge of musical terminology (intervals, cadences) are prerequisites. This fulfills a theory requirement for music majors. Class size:\n20",

The projects are sequenced in a way that the students move from a simple dialogue of light and dark and gradually begin to incorporate a fuller range of elements from the vocabulary of painting during the semester. Assignments are designed to promote a recognition that expression in painting is rooted in its form \u2013 color, light, materiality, composition, etc. While much of the work will be done from observation - still life, landscape (weather permitting) and model - there will be assignments that incorporate abstraction as well.

Students will develop and refine their drawn, cut, carved and printed line. We will follow the tradition of Japanese mokuhanga woodblock printing, and emphasize water-based and water-soluble inks in our practice. Our processes will incorporate laser etching, as well as paper gluing and laser cutting techniques. We seek to engage with printmaking as the means to create a visual language, expand our knowledge base of printmaking as a historical and contemporary mode of art making, and broaden our experiences working on and with paper.

The issues discussed in Painting I, mainly the language of color, value, temperature, contrast, saturation, intensity, etc. and strong structural relationships, will serve as building blocks for complex figurative compositions. We will be also working from reproductions as we study some of the great figurative masters. Students will be expected to be on time and have the proper equipment. This includes a good assortment of brushes, a proper palette and the required colors. Students will be working on gessoed paper over the first weeks but should know how to stretch and prime a canvas properly. Some of the poses will extend over two weeks, which will allow students to begin to push their work into new places. This class is for students who want to work hard and extend themselves. Students should have experience in drawing and must have had Painting I, there will be no exceptions. Class size: 14",

Students first develop their vocal apparatus by applying a range of techniques (including Fitzmaurice Voicework, Linklater, and yoga) to rid the body of tension and free the authentic voice. From this place of release, students will then learn to safely support their voices, allowing greater range and variety of vocal character. Students will be taught to apply this broadened vocal pallet to the performance of text, discovering the possibilities available through both exploration and conscious shifts in the voice and body. The result will be a profound connection between body, breath, voice and language. Students will also leave with a toolkit of safe warm ups and preparatory exercises that can be used in rehearsals and private practice. While the course is primarily intended for Theater & Performance students, it may be of interest to others who which to develop their public speaking skills. This course fulfills a Technique requirement in the Theater & Performance Program. Class size: 14",

We will ask questions about interpretation, ephemerality, and reenactment, investigate how great artists from across the centuries have controlled our experience of theatrical time and space, and examine such topics as the representation of reality on stage, the relationship between performance and audience, and the constantly evolving interplay of theater and democracy.

This interdisciplinary course, covering performance and power of the early modern period, will disrupt habitual assumptions about both the disciplines of theater and history. Students will read baroque plays, study their historical contexts, and experiment with staging scenes, to uncover the links between imagined and actual Atlantic expansion and the impact of colonialism, 1492-1825. Artistic forms to be examined include the English court masque, the Spanish auto sacramental, and spectacles of power and conversion staged in the colonial Americas; plays will range from Shakespeare's The Tempest to Marivaux's The Island of Slaves to allegorical works by Calderon, Lope de Vega, Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz, and more.

Students will experiment with creating fictional work based on the gut impulses of the body, their own personal narratives, and whatever traditional or non-traditional sound and music-based skills they bring to the classroom. Theories of narrative and dramatic structure will be examined, and students will experiment with methods and techniques for applying these creatively in practice. We will examine how several contemporary artists and ensembles (i.e. Bridget Everett, Kyary Pamyu Pamyu, Bjork, FKA Twigs, Trust Your Moves Chorus, Toshi Reagan, Half Straddle, Meredith Monk) generate new music and sound driven works.

In it we will explore the collaborative relationship between the playwright and the director within the process of developing new works for the stage. While new play development is ubiquitously touted in the literature of many professional theater companies, there is little agreement regarding what this term actually means. Often playwrights are paired with directors who are tasked with helping them realize their vision, although other collaborative models exist. In this class, playwrights and directors will be paired up to develop new works generated by the writer. Through this experience, we will explore the roles and relationship between writer and director when working on a new play; the rules of engagement between them; and the collaborative nature of the process as well as its limits. We will also explore questions such as: how collaborative is the process meant to be? Is each collaborative process unique? How do decisions get made, and who gets to make them? Students will assist each other by reading roles in each other\u2019s plays. The course will culminate in stage readings of new work generated in the course.

This question drives Geoffrey Chaucer\u2019s Canterbury Tales and will likewise guide our semester-long exploration of it. An instant classic after Chaucer\u2019s death in 1400, The Canterbury Tales inspired \"fan fiction\" almost immediately and has since been enshrined as an essential work within the English literary canon, counting writers from Shakespeare to T.S. Eliot among its later readers and admirers. At odds with (or perhaps partly responsible for) its current \"insider\" and canonical status, though, is the fact that The Canterbury Tales remains one of the most radically experimental works written in English. By turns beautiful and dirty, politically risky and calculatedly evasive, poetry and prose, the Tales tests, negotiates, and worries over the ways in which language\u2014written, spoken, read, overheard\u2014constructs reality. It challenges gender and class norms; queries and queers the relationship between tale and teller; and calls into question institutional authority and social hierarchy. Following Chaucer\u2019s lead, we\u2019ll grapple with how literature does (and sometimes does not) influence social change; that is, what\u2019s the point of telling stories?

This paradox raises some knotty questions of aesthetics, sensation, and media, questions that become still more complicated in the context of American literature from the mid-19th to the mid-20th century. Over this period, shifts in migration, labor, transport, and the built environment radically alter what cities sound like, while audio recording and reproduction technologies reconfigure the forms and functions of popular music. American poets, novelists, and essayists, meanwhile, experiment with new ways of writing sound: new rhythms, new structures of narrative voice, new ideas about sonic experience as a function of cultural difference and of ability. To get a sense of these experiments, we\u2019ll concentrate on moments in which technology, identity, environment, and hearing tightly interweave (as when the train whistles past Thoreau at Walden Pond). We\u2019ll track the adaptation of literary texts across media, from print to performance to phonograph (as when Abbey Lincoln sings a Paul Laurence Dunbar poem). And we\u2019ll engage with the theoretical questions that emerge around terms like \"soundscape\" itself--a concept first coined as a way of describing the noise of urban infrastructure, even as it nods to traditions of pastoral aesthetics. As a Junior Seminar, the course will emphasize methods of research and argumentation that will be of use not only in literary sound studies, but also in Senior Projects in the humanities more generally. Likely figures: James Baldwin, John Cage, Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, Charlie Chaplin, Emily Dickinson, William Faulkner, Zora Neale Hurston, and Helen Keller. This course is a Literature Junior Seminar course.\nClass size: 12",

        "description": "Cross-listed: Middle Eastern Studies World Literature retains a central but debatable prestige in contemporary literary studies. Some view World Literature as an inevitable consequence of a more-connected world in the wake of the global marketplace; others view it as a term which conceals asymmetrical linguistic power relations and furthers the power of English as a literary language. Certainly, Arabic literature has been globally received through the category of World Literature. This course assesses different understandings of \"World Literature\" and in turn complicates our contemporary reception of Arabic Literature. We will read Arabic literary texts and pair them with a diverse selection of theoretical material, examining the problematics and politics of translation. This course will read Arabic authors from the nineteenth to the twenty-first century, such as Ahmad Faris al-Shidyaq, Tayyib Salih, Naguib Mahfouz, and Mohamed el-Bisatie. Theoretical readings will include essays by Emily Apter, Gayatri Spivak, Pascal Casanova, David Damrosch. This course is part of the World Literature offering. Class size: 20",

Along the way, students encounter such aspects of poetic form as patterns of repetition; the infinite varieties of syntax, punctuation, meter, and typography; the \"color\" of vowels; and the rhythmic implications of word choice and sentence structure. Participants explore a range of techniques and materials from around the world and from the beginning of recorded history right up to the present moment.

How does one, when given 5000 words of real estate in the New Yorker, or Harper's, or The New York Review of Books, write an essay that will engage a new work -- a collection of poetry or stories; a novel; a biography of a writer of any of these forms -- and offer an opinion of the work's merits that is as fair to the ambitions of the author in question as it is to the larger endeavor of literary enterprise? How, in short, do you say what you think while the clock ticks? How do you do that in a literary culture with diminishing space given over to this essential humanistic endeavor: the public conversation about books? And who should have the privilege of writing about such things? In this workshop, we will read examples of literary criticism from throughout its history, including writing by Samuel Johnson, William Hazlitt, Virginia Wolff, Edmund Wilson, Mary McCarthy, John Updike, Denis Donoghue, Susan Sontag, David Foster Wallace, Thomas Chatterton Williams, John Jeremiah Sullivan, Roxane Gay, Rivka Galchen, and James Wood. Through this exposure to the varieties of argumentative experience, we will learn how such pieces are structured and how arguments -- aesthetic ones -- are mounted and defended, to the end of writing a final, 5000-word piece of long-form literary criticism of our own.

How did Proust describe a landscape or a painting? How does Nathaniel Mackey capture the sound of jazz? We will listen to music, look at pictures, walk through our surroundings, and write descriptions of what we experience, noticing the ways our moods and memories affect what we perceive and how we write. If we cannot attend to the particulars of the world in which we live, how can we hope to distinguish between real and fake, true and false?

        "department": "writers",
        "description": "Cross-listed: Environmental & Urban Studies; Experimental Humanities; Human Rights P hilosopher Thomas Nagel asked, \"What is it like to be a bat?\" Ultimately, he determined the question unanswerable: A bat\u2019s experience of the world is so alien to our own that it is beyond the human understanding of subjective experience. That\u2019s arguable. But it is true at least that a bat\u2019s experience\u2014or that of any other nonhuman consciousness\u2014is not inaccessible to human imagination. In this course we will read and discuss a wide variety of texts, approaching the subject of nonhuman consciousness through literature, philosophy, and science. We will read works that attempt to understand the experiences of apes, panthers, rats, ticks, elephants, octopuses, lobsters, cows, bats, monsters, puppets, computers, and eventually, zombies. Course reading may include Descartes, Kafka, Rilke, Jakob von Uexk\u00fcll, Patricia Highsmith, John Gardner\u2019s Grendel, J.A. Baker\u2019s The Peregrine, Eduardo Kohn\u2019s How Forests Think, David Foster Wallace, Temple Grandin, Frans de Waal, Jane Goodall, Thomas Nagel, John Searle, Susan Datich, E. O. Wilson, Giorgio Agamben, and Bennett Sims\u2019s A Questionable Shape, among others, in addition to a viewing of 2001: A Space Odyssey, Danny Boyle\u2019s 28 Days Later, and possibly other films. This is also a craft class, as each student will produce a substantial project over the semester. The assignments will be open-ended, open to both creative and analytical works; a major component of the class will be incorporating these ideas into our own writing. This course is part of the Thinking Animals Initiative, an interdivisional collaboration among students and faculty to further the understanding of animals and human-animal relationships. Students interested in this workshop must email bhale@bard.edu by December 9th for instructions. Class size: 12",

The primary purpose is to guide seniors, both practically and philosophically, in the daunting task of creating a coherent and inspired creative work of high quality within a single academic year. Emphasis is on demystifying the project process, including its bureaucratic hurdles, as well as exploring the role of research in the creative realm, and helping students use each other as a critical and inspirational resource during this protracted solitary endeavor, sharing works in progress when appropriate. This supplements but never supplants the primary and sacrosanct role of the project adviser. Program faculty and alumni/ae, career development and other staff, and outside speakers (such as editors, translators, MFA graduates and directors, publishing personnel, etc.) contribute their collective wisdom and experience, sharing the myriad ways in which writers move an idea toward full creative realization, and giving a glimpse of the kinds of internships and careers available to the writer. Required for students enrolled in a Written Arts Senior Project. All such students are enrolled automatically by the Registrar. Class size: 30",

The readings provide a rich ground for cultural investigation, intellectual exchange, in-class debates, in-depth examination of stylistics and, of course, vocabulary acquisition.

        "department": "french",
        "description": "Cross-listed: Gender and Sexuality Studies; Literature The representation of private life in the nineteenth-century French novel coincided with the advent of Realism. Realism not only described the institutions that shaped private life (i.e., marriage, education, religion), but dwelled also on the discrete dramas occurring backstage--the solitude of the spinster (Flaubert's Un C\u0153ur simple), the plight of the child (Vall\u00e8s' L'Enfant, Renard's Poil de Carotte), the ambiguities of filial duties(Balzac, Eugenie Grandet, Flaubert Madame Bovary), the despair of domesticity (Maupassant's Une Vie), and the nature of neuroses (Zola, Nana). Using novels, stories, and short selections from journals and correspondences, this course will examine the emergence of writings previously considered too private, too personal to be viewed as literature. Students will also uncover the techniques that help dramatize these highly subjective conflicts (interior monologue, free indirect discourse, early examples of flow of consciousness). Issues of gender, sexuality, and the role of women in defining domesticity will be central. In order to situate these texts within a tradition that rethinks the self, there will be additional readings by Locke, Descartes, Kant, and Shaftesbury. Students will also read excerpts from recent anthologies about everyday life to examine the connection between literature, philosophy, social history, and anthropology. Taught in French.

Exile has always been a crucial aspect of the Italian consciousness, from the medieval period to today. This course explores the idea of exile broadly, as both exile from a place and exile to another place. What does it mean to be exiled within Italy? How does this differ from exile from Italy? Rather than focusing on a specific time period, this course offers a thematic survey from Dante to the twenty-first century. Readings will include excerpts from Dante\u2019s Comedy, Machiavelli\u2019s The Prince, Antonio Gramsci\u2019s political writings, the prison letters of Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, and Igiaba Scego\u2019s novel La mia casa \u00e8 dove sono. This course constitutes a first introduction to Italian civilization and culture for students who have completed Intermediate Italian. Through in-class discussions, grammar drills, written work, presentations, and performances, it offers an opportunity for students to hone their linguistic skills and actively engage with the complexities of Italian identity, past and present.

Mammals are a fairly specialized group of creatures with two notable features \u2013 they produce nutritious milk to feed their offspring and they maintain a constant internal body temperature, though doing so requires them to eat with near comical frequency. Despite our inherent familiarity with a number of mammalian traits, many people are unaware that some of our mammalian relatives lay eggs, others produce venomous saliva, and yet others live in ant-like colonies with a single queen surrounded by a worker caste whose members don\u2019t reproduce. More surprising still might be that over 1000 new species of mammals have been described in the past 15 years. Yet compared to other forms of life, like plants or microbes or insects, mammals are extremely rare, representing just a tiny fraction of living organisms. In this course, we will explore the ecology, behavior, physiology, diversity, and evolution of mammals, and put these characteristics into context by considering how they compare to the characteristics of other groups. Most importantly, we will explore what focusing on mammals can teach us about life on Earth, particularly in the 21st century as the planet warms and little of the land or sea is untouched by the influence of humans, a particularly adaptable and abundant species of mammal.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Mind, Brain, Behavior Have you ever asked yourself, \"Why did that animal do that?\" There are many levels at which we could seek answers, running from proximal mechanisms (firing neurons and hormonal stimuli) through ultimate mechanisms (the evolutionary selective pressures which produce adaptive behaviors through natural selection). This course is primarily about the latter. In it, we seek answers to why organisms evolve various mating strategies, what accounts for differences in sexual characteristics and mate choice among males and females, how organisms use signals, the information they contain, whether they signal honest information or whether we expect to see cheaters within populations, conflicts of interest between siblings, parents and offspring, males and females, and so on. We explore these questions through lab and field experiments and using evolutionary game theory, which provides the underlying framework for understanding the evolution of animal behaviors. The lab portion of the class will allow you to learn new methods and technologies (e.g. bioacoustic recording and analysis, avian point counts and transects) useful in studying animal behavior, work individually and in groups to design experiments and models to test your own hypotheses. Research will focus on captive animals in Bard\u2019s laboratories, wild animals on Bard\u2019s campus and within the surrounding natural landscape, and on captive animals housed in a local zoo. As a capstone achievement, you will identify an important basic or applied question in animal behavior and write a professional National Science Foundation-style proposal advocating for the funding of a research project of your own design.

        "description": "Urban development is among the most pervasive and ubiquitous forms of land cover change. Thus, urbanization poses significant challenges to many organisms, including humans. Urban Ecology is a seminar course in which students focus on the processes determining patterns of abundance and distribution of organisms in urban ecosystems, the interactions among organisms in the urban environment, behavioral and evolutionary responses that facilitate adaptation to urban environments, and the interactions between humans and nature in urban environments. Urban organisms and ecosystems also provide services (e.g. temperature mitigation, pest control) to humans and we will focus on aspects of urban planning as it relates to maximizing those services. We will link key case studies focused on the Hudson Valley and NY metropolitan areas to eco-evolutionary theory and an understanding of how to design urban landscapes in ways that provide key ecosystem services that humans need to survive. Students will specialize in urban ecological and evolutionary areas of their own interest, and learn to navigate the scientific and gray literature to gather, critique and organize ideas. As a capstone project, students will identify a key gap in our understanding of basic or applied urban ecology and design a research proposal targeting a funding agency to carry out that work.

If no one asks of me, I know; if I wish to explain to him who asks, I know not.\" 1500 years later, Einstein revolutionized physics by recognizing that time is malleable: he showed that simultaneity depends on how you are moving, and that clocks in motion or acted on by gravity measure time differently. In this course we will take up a detailed examination of the evolving physical description of the nature of time, which can seem to clash with our \u2018common sense\u2019 perception of time. We will examine the physics that helps us pursue conceptual clarity on this and several other foundational aspects of the nature of time. This will entail a focus on the measurement of time and a detailed study of clocks. Throughout we will test our ideas about time and clocks through laboratory experiments.

This course will trace the history of the 'culture concept' from the nineteenth century to the present. In doing so, it will explore anthropological approaches to 'non-modern' societies, group and personal symbols, and systems of exchange. It will examine how anthropology came to focus on questions of identity, race, gender, sexuality, nationalism, colonial and post-colonial conditions. Our ethnographic gaze will be turned inward as well as outward. We will therefore consider the reasons behind, and ramifications of, anthropology's self-reflexive turn in and around the 1980s. We will consider debates about anthropologists' engagement in activism, policy and government. We will then examine the more recent anthropological fascination with the non-human (e.g. other animals, technology, the built environment, 'nature'), looking at how notions of agency, materiality, and anthropology's own methodological foundations have been transformed as a result.

No other colony was more prized or the object of more fantasy than India, \"The Jewel in the Crown.\" While the course focuses on British rule in India, we will frame this particular case within broader perspectives of colonialism and empire, including Edward Said's analysis of Orientalism, critical responses to it, and the ideology of liberalism that underwrote the colonial project. A central premise of the course is that the experience of colonialism was shared by both colonizer and colonized. Imperialism did not only profoundly change the cultures of the Indian subcontinent but also British people themselves \u2013 both those who were first-hand participants (soldiers, administrators, entrepreneurs, etc.) and those citizens who never left Britain. We will discuss political movements, like nationalism, feminism, and liberalism, not as a discourse that originated in the metropole and was exported to the colonies, but rather a key aspect of the colonial encounter in both places. The focus of our discussion of imperial politics and practices will be on the role of \u2018culture\u2019 and ideas about \u2018humanity\u2019 as a central discourse that emerged at this same time. Towards the end of the class, we will examine new forms of rule that followed in the postcolonial period, namely the rise of development and humanitarian aid. We will discuss the cultural politics of humanitarian aid in relation to the politics of empire, tracing its similarities and important differences. Students will be required to do presentations and a final research paper that examines the cultural politics of one particular debate, event, or practice central to imperial rule. Class size: 22",

After a mass emigration from the Rhineland, and two years of forced labor conditions under British colonists, the economy of these orchard farmers, vintners, and artisans began to flourish in the central Hudson Valley. Their diaspora from here established the Mohawk Valley's Palatines, the Pennsylvania Deutsch, and the Shenandoah Germans in Virginia. Before 1750 our site, the Calvinist minister\u2019s home (or Parsonage) was the scene of visits from Mohicans, likely from a Moravian mission village in the Taconic hills east of Bard, their last settlement in New York. African Americans lived at the site as slaves by the 1780s, if not decades earlier. We have found traces of their spiritual practices for protection and healing. In the mid-1800s, several free African American families established a neighborhood nearby that may have lasted until the early 20th Century. We\u2019ll do 3.5-hour excavation and/or lab sessions on Fridays, or weekend afternoons before mid-term, to find more evidence of ritual concealment, working at times with local middle school students. To better contextualize our research, we\u2019ll study background texts to write short papers for weekly seminars. Please consult with the professor in advance of enrollment.

And it affects everyone\u2014regardless of their own migratory status. This course examines the history of migration from local, national, and global perspectives, with particular emphasis on the uneven economic and geopolitical developments that have produced specific forms of mobility into and through the U.S. The course also traces the emergence of new modes of border regulation and migration governance as well as novel forms of migrant cultural production and representation. Above all, it aims to provide students with the tools to engage critically with many of the concepts and buzzwords\u2014among them \"asylum,\" \"border,\" \"belonging,\" \"citizenship,\" and \"illegality\"\u2014that define contemporary public debates.

In class, students will read from traditions that grapple with problems at the intersection of social science and social change, focusing on sources important to anthropology, including texts by Vico, Marx, Tax, Scheper-Hughes, Hale, Kesha-Kahn Perry, and Speed. We will consider influences from constructivism, pragmatism, collaborative anthropology, and militant anthropology. The class will promote an analytic engagement with human services, encouraging us to think in an anthropological vein and emphasizing the practice of participant observation. Outside of the classroom, students will commit to a semester-long internship with a group that carries out community organizing or social service. We will strive to produce research that advances the project of the groups to which we are committed.

In what ways has violence become naturalized in the contemporary world? In this course, we will consider how acts of violence challenge and support modern ideas of humanity, raising important questions about what it means to be human today. These questions lie at the heart of anthropological thinking and also structure contemporary discussions of human rights. Anthropology\u2019s commitment to \"local culture\" and cultural diversity has meant that anthropologists often position themselves in critical opposition to \"universal values,\" which have been used to address various forms of violence in the contemporary world. The course will approach different forms of violence, including ethnic and communal conflicts, colonial education, torture and its individualizing effects, acts of terror and institutionalized fear, and rituals of bodily pain that mark individuals\u2019 inclusion or exclusion from a social group. The course is organized around three central concerns. First, we will discuss violence as a means of producing and consolidating social and political power, and exerting political control. Second, we will look at forms of violence that have generated questions about \"universal rights\" of humanity versus culturally specific practices, such as widow burning in India and female genital mutilation in postcolonial Africa. In these examples, we explore gendered dimensions in the experience of violence among perpetrators, victims, and survivors. Finally, we will look at the ways human rights institutions have sought to address the profundity of human suffering and pain, and ask in what ways have they succeeded and/or failed. Readings will range from theoretical texts, anthropological ethnographies, as well as popular representations of violence in the media and film. Class size: 22",

        "description": "Cross-listed: Africana Studies; Environmental & Urban Studies; Global & International Studies; Human Rights Western fantasies have historically represented Africa as the embodiment of a mythical, primordial wilderness. Within this imagery, nature is racialized, and Africans are constructed as existing in a state closer to nature. Conrad\u2019s Heart of Darkness perhaps best exemplifies this process, through its exploration of the \u2018savage\u2019 dimensions of colonialism in the African interior. Imperial discourses often relied on these tropes of savagery and barbarism to link understandings of natural history with ideas about racial difference. Similarly, by blurring the boundary between the human and the nonhuman, colonial policies created a zone of anxiety around racialized domestic relationships, particularly in the context of employers and their servants. Many of these representations were contradictory, as evidenced by Rousseau\u2019s image of the noble savage: indigenous people who lived as gentle custodians of the environment, while at the same time preying upon resources desired for exclusive colonial use. After investigating the racialization of nature under imperial regimes, we will consider continuing legacies in post-colonial situations. How have certain ethnic identities been linked to nature? How do these associations reproduce social hierarchies and inequalities? In what ways is race invoked in struggles for land and resource rights? Through an exploration of ethnographic accounts, historical analyses, and works of fiction based in Africa, this course offers a new way of deciphering cultural representations of nature, and the fundamentally political agendas that lie within.

Ethnography is the cornerstone of contemporary cultural anthropology, and includes both fieldwork and representation. This course is a survey of, and practicum in, ethnographic field methods. We will study and critique traditional ethnographic methods such as participant-observation, interviewing, archival research, visual, sonic, textual and spatial analysis, and address the challenges of doing fieldwork in a variety of contexts, including the virtual domain. A series of sequenced intensive research exercises will raise guiding questions about how ethnographic research can be ethically and effectively \"translated\" into written text. We attend also to emergent ethnographic forms and methods, such as multi-sited ethnography, critical moral anthropology, and indigenous methodologies and critiques. To complement the fieldwork projects, we will also read exemplary, and sometimes controversial, texts of ethnography in practice. Students will develop a community- or environmentally-based ethnographic research project of their own design throughout the course of the semester. Ethical aspects of conducting ethnographic fieldwork, including preparing for Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, will be addressed.

Based on the principle that environmental conditions are the product of political processes, the field is interdisciplinary in orientation, integrating the work of anthropologists, geographers, historians, political scientists, and sociologists. Through close attention to local historical and social contexts, we will explore topics such as the politics of knowledge, state power, sustainable development, mapping, urban ecology, corporations and conservation, and multilateral environmental governance. The majority of the readings will be drawn from case studies in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Priority will be given to moderated students in Anthropology and Environmental and Urban Studies. Class size: 15",

The microeconomics component of the course develops the basic model of consumer and firm behavior, including demand and supply, in the context of an idealized competitive market and examines several ways in which the real world deviates from this model\u2014including monopoly and other forms of imperfect competition; information problems; minimum wages and other price controls; taxes; and government regulation. The macroeconomics component studies the aggregate behavior of modern economies - the factors leading to economic growth, explanations of booms and recessions, unemployment, interest rates, inflation, and budget deficits or surpluses \u2013 and the government\u2019s ability (or inability) to use monetary and fiscal policies to achieve economic goals such as full employment and price stability.

In this course, we attempt to achieve the following three objectives: (1) Understand all the concepts covered in Introduction to Microeconomics in terms of mathematics; (2) Study advanced topics such as choice under uncertainty and information asymmetry that have traditionally relied on mathematics for illustration of ideas; and (3) Learn how to use mathematics to conduct in-depth economic analysis. In order to meet the last objective, we will devote most of the weekly \"lab\" sessions toward problem solving. During the lab sessions, students are expected to take turns explaining how to solve a particular problem to the rest of the class.

An important part of the course is to investigate the role of governments in affecting the long run and short run economic prospects of their countries.

Since Adam Smith, economists have used different assumptions, models and methodologies to study the role of markets, states, and institutions in the process of social provisioning. This course will survey the diverse traditions in economics and introduce students to competing paradigms. It covers several distinct approaches including Classical Political Economy, Neoclassical, Institutionalist, Post Keynesian, Marxist, Feminist, Development and Green Economics. The objective is to gain a broad appreciation of the specific problems that each of these traditions emphasizes and the contributions to theory and policy each has made. Students will examine not only the evolution of ideas and theories, but also their practical application today. Some of the specific issues that the course will consider include the causes and cures for unemployment, the evolution and interaction of culture, technology and the environment, and the role and nature of money in shaping the modern world.

The positive analyses of ECE are motivated by three normative social goals: (1) efficient allocation of scarce resources, including those\u2014such as ecosystem services\u2014that do not pass through markets; (2) justice in distribution; and (3) an ecologically sustainable scale of economic activity.

Although dating back in its modern form to only the sixteenth century, the concept of the experiment as an attempt to find underlying continuities in experience has numerous origins stretching back to earliest recorded history. In this course, we will look at several different epochs' definition of experiment, focusing on the classical, medieval, and finally renaissance eras to the present. Throughout, we will understand the concept of experiment as closely connected with an era's broader cosmology and definition of experience, and as such will see the epistemological problem of the experiment in a framework that includes aesthetics, theology, ethics and politics. We will also assume that \"experiment\" has taken different forms in the different sciences, and even in fields such as art and law. Class size: 22",

This course explores the transformations of Confucian philosophy, social ethics, and political thought, from its ancient origins through the present, focusing on five key moments of change. Close readings in seminal Confucian texts provide a foundation in the earliest Confucian ideas of benevolence, rites, and righteousness. We then delve into the ideas of China\u2019s middle-period Neo-Confucian thinkers Zhu Xi and Wang Yangming, who pondered universal principle, the Great Ultimate, and innate human goodness. The third segment of the course analyzes the globalization of Confucian thought during the 16 th through the 19 th centuries, as Jesuit missionary translations of Confucian texts inspired the European Enlightenment and European imperialism sparked Chinese thinkers\u2019 reformulation of \"Confucianism\" as a bounded, continuous tradition. The fourth segment of the course reconstructs how Confucian thought shaped Western ideas of rights as they entered East Asian politics and explores how Confucian concepts of humanity, relational ethics, and social responsibility may offer alternatives to Euro-American rights discourse. Finally, the course considers the contemporary Confucian revival as manifested in popular culture, tourism, neo-liberal economic discourse, and East Asian state authoritarianism. No prior study of Chinese language or history is required; first-year students are welcome. Class size: 22",

Opposition to book learning, intellectualism, and expertise may only be as old as the wide-scale presence of books, intellectuals, and experts in social life. In other words, however seemingly universal and transhistorical folk knowledge, proverbial wisdom, and, especially, common sense are presented, their meaning, significance, and practice have changed over time. Their politicization in France, Great Britain, and the United States is, in fact, distinctly modern. Born not only of struggles between tradition and innovation, common sense emerged in the early-modern global contact between Africans, indigenous peoples, and Europeans, lettered and illiterate, articulating rights during the revolutionary formations of nation and empire. The course begins around the time of Thomas Paine\u2019s Common Sense and ends with the trickster politics of later 20th/21st-century Brazil, Ghana, and the United States.

The history of the theater, therefore, is inextricably connected with the history of how societies have performed conquest, colonialism, and cultural patrimony in different parts of the world. This interdisciplinary course, covering performance and power of the early modern period, will disrupt habitual assumptions about both the disciplines of theater and history. Students will read baroque plays, study their historical contexts, and experiment with staging scenes, to uncover the links between imagined and actual Atlantic expansion and the impact of colonialism, 1492-1825. Artistic forms to be examined include the English court masque, the Spanish auto sacramental, and spectacles of power and conversion staged in the colonial Americas; plays will range from Shakespeare's The Tempest to Marivaux's The Island of Slaves to allegorical works by Calderon, Lope de Vega, Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz, and more.

The very name \"Latin America\" derived from and became associated with specific racial, religious, and revolutionary meanings through a history of violence. The seminar will begin by studying how racial concepts formed and became fixed ideas through distinct revolutionary-inspired intellectual debates on interracial mixture and indigenous rights. Based in Mexico and Peru, the formation of concepts like global mestizaje, a \"cosmic race,\" and indigenismo involved rival valuations of each nation\u2019s indigenous and colonial histories and cultures, with lasting effects. The seminar will then explore the simultaneous rise of wars and conflicts over radically different religious meanings and faiths, within and outside of Catholicism, including native religions and the rise of Evangelical Protestant Christianity. The latter part of the seminar will focus on Guatemala, which dramatically combined extreme violence over race, religion, and revolution, and focused global attention on indigenous rights and human rights. These histories will allow for a deeper understanding of the rise of different forms of violence in Central America today, and therefore of the current human rights, migrant, and refugee crisis centered there and involving other parts of Latin America and the US. This seminar emphasizes the narratives, interpretations, and voices of participants in the history, and critical engagement with these primary sources in the writing of the history. ",

        "description": "Cross-listed: Experimental Humanities; Irish and Celtic Studies In 1725, Giambattista Vico presented to the world a \"New Science\" of poetic imagination that was intended as a point-by-point re-contextualization of the already established foundations of the natural sciences of Rene Descartes and Francis Bacon. In 1939, with much of the world enveloped in fascism and on the verge of a new technological war, James Joyce presented an immersive demonstration of Vico's science in Finnegans Wake. By turns confusing, hilarious, and profound, Joyce's \"vicociclometer\" sought to provide a reorientation in myth and history of the relation of ancient and modern life, religion, and politics. In this course, we will use the \"exception\" provided by both texts to look at the norms of modern intellectual history, using selections in their context to reconsider the background assumptions of modern societies and their political implications. Central issues will include the destruction of oral and traditional cultures (and peoples) by print based-civilizations, the function of science and myth in the organization of modern life (particularly as mediated by law), the definition of individuals and collectives by narrative and institutional form, the relation of written history to power, the function of technological media in politics, and the place of complexity in aesthetics and life. A central theme will be the history of the book as it develops among other media technologies, which we will thematize through the use of Bard's collection of the facsimiles of Joyce's voluminous notecards on Finnegans Wake (the so-called \"Buffalo Manuscripts\").",

The course begins with the late Ottoman period (the 19th century) and continues through the formation of the Syrian and Lebanese states, including the colonial, post-colonial, and contemporary periods. Of particular interest will be the changes and continuities in class composition, gender relations, sectarianism, and national identities. The focus will be on how social practices (e.g., urban planning, family organization, rural-urban migration, etc.) and cultural forms (e.g., novels, plays, songs, films, etc.) intersect with those changes and continuities. For example, how do transformations in the public sphere (e.g., the proliferation of newspapers, squares, and cafes) relate to the emergence of middle and working classes? Alternatively, how were new articulations of masculinities and femininities reflected in literary production, commercial advertisements, and/or school curricula? In what ways did realities of border demarcation and enforcement, along with the organization of representative institutions, challenge, create, or reinforce specific notions of self and community? Moreover, how did prolonged civil war in Lebanon or authoritarian rule in Syria shape the form and content of artistic practices produced in each of those two countries? The course will explore these and many other questions through a chronologically organized syllabus, adopting a comparative perspective that will consider developments in Syria and Lebanon in relation to one another, to the broader Middle East and North Africa (MENA), and to the world.

These boundaries have been socially created, and as such have changed over time (both in rigidity and in terms of the groups involved). We will examine these three kinds of intermarriage in this course but focus especially on racial and ethnic mixing, past and present (including prospects for the future). Thus, part of our concern will be with the experiences of the couples who crossed the relevant boundaries and how contemporaries viewed them. However, as social observers have always stressed, some of the most intriguing implications of such unions do not concern merely the couples themselves but their descendants. These descendants have had a great impact on group continuity or group melding (\u2018assimilation\u2019) in America\u2019s past and present. Indeed, viewed from the perspective of the country as a whole and across generations, American experiences of high and low levels of intermarriage have been related to respectively succeeding or failing to incorporate different peoples into the mainstream of its citizenry. The seminar deals not only with the social processes involved, but also with the intellectual understandings of those processes over time: how such intermarrying couples and and their descendants have been understood, and how has the American census in particular classified people of mixed origins? Students\u2019 major writing assignment will be a term paper, typically based partly on primary sources. Class size: 12",

Building on this discussion, we will then turn to questions of why it is appropriate to believe what other people tell us\u2014do we have to believe that they are trustworthy? Finally, we will turn to a discussion of problems that arise from the fact that our beliefs are formed in social environments\u2014where people disagree and sometimes choose to ignore information. What should we do when our beliefs conflict with others\u2019? How does membership in a cultural group impair or facilitate our having or sharing knowledge?

A good deal of recent philosophy, though, explores the possibility that we might not be \"rational all the way out\" and that we use concepts to supplement other, embodied ways of knowing, being, and being with others. The first part of this course examines conceptual and non-conceptual ways that we make sense of reality. We then look at ways that bodies conform to or reconfigure social ideals of normalcy. The readings that we encounter argue for a more inclusive form of realism in our accounts of perception, action, language and intelligence, and we consider a plurality of diverse embodiments and a range of understandings of the ways that bodied selves and social life are woven together. Readings include HL Dreyfus, M. Merleau-Ponty, Julia Kristeva, Judith Butler, Michel Foucault, Samuel Todes, Patricia Brennan, Jack Halberstam, and others. Class size: 18",

From there, we will turn to broader topics that cut across various art forms: Are serious (or \"high\") and popular (or \"low\") art to be understood and evaluated differently? How do we evaluate works of art, and why do we so often disagree on their value? And what, if anything, do the various items and activities that we classify as \"art\" have in common?

Following this we will work through his widely influential How to Do Things with Words, examining in detail what, thanks to him, we now call performative speech and speech-acts. At the close of the course we will look into the Austinian tradition in selected writings of Paul Grice and Stanley Cavell.

Among the questions we would ask are: Why are some countries rich and others poor? What is development? What are the prime movers of globalization? Is the US an empire given its influence and power in the global economy? How can development be redefined to tackle the challenge of climate change? Among issues that we will look at closely is the role of organizations such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the World Trade Organization in managing the global economy and the current debates about reforming these institutions.

North Africa as a region is understudied in the US and often neglected by US policymakers until dramatic events require immediate attention. This course examines five different policy challenges the US has faced, thereby highlighting key overall aspects in the history, formulation and implementation of American foreign policy and exploring specific aspects of the US relationship with the countries across North Africa (Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya and Egypt). For a variety of historical reasons Egypt is not usually included in this regional grouping but is included here to offer the full complement of countries across the region. Its inclusion also allows for a presentation of one case that is a traditional bulwark of US policy. The full set of cases covered by the course includes: Morocco - human rights versus monarchical stability; Algeria - Islamist revolt and the implications of US ambiguity; Tunisia - Hopes for change and US indifference; Libya - regime change and ensuing chaos; and, Egypt - American misreadings and missed opportunities following the revolution. Readings will include US government documents, policy analyses and scholarly articles. Students will engage in simulations and meet with guest lecturers who have been or are currently in policymaking positions. Class size: 18",

Yet their role in political orders is complex, varied, and dynamic\u2014and frequently not aligned with the common good, or with democratic conceptions of politics. Our task in this course is to look at recent superhero movies as a continuation of this long tradition of heroic politics and to critically examine their potential for (or against) democratic practices: what kinds of political relationships do these stories imagine or support? Do superheroes function as good ethical and political role models that empower audiences? Or are they disempowering, teaching audiences to trust in the strengths of exceptional individuals (or exceptional states) instead of their own capacities? Can these stories teach us to be better citizens or are heroic narratives dangerous? To address these questions, this class will consider a selection of recent super-hero films alongside works of political theory, analyzing questions of democratic agency, courage, and state power. Among others, we will read works by Arendt, Rousseau, Nietzsche, Schmitt, and Plato; films such as Wonder Woman, Black Panther, and The Avengers will also be assigned. This course is part of the Courage to Be Seminar Series and students will be required to attend 3 Monday evening lectures associated with the series. Class size: 20",

        "description": "Cross-listed: Global & International Studies; Human Rights; Middle Eastern Studies The twentieth century was the century of nationalism and the century when the nation-state as a form of political organization became universalized. But the difficulties with the idealized model of the nation-state are quite apparent for all to see. For instance, various forms of ethno-national mobilization--based on solidarities both larger and smaller than the nation-state\u2014have challenged official state nationalisms. The twenty first century opened with talk of moving beyond the nation-state. But at that time in certain parts of the world multi-national political spaces were getting reorganized along national lines. This was also when failing and collapsed states became top foreign policy concerns of major powers, and a new form of international regimes of intervention came into being. The course will examine the idea of the nation -- its historical and contemporary competitors -- the emergence of the nation-state system, and the challenges confronting this system. Our approach will be comparative and we will draw on the experiences of all world regions. Interested students should email Prof. Baruah prior to registration (baruah@bard.edu) with a short statement of why they would like to take this class. Class size: 15",

        "description": "Cross-listed: Environmental & Urban Studies; Global & International Studies; Human Rights The study of economic development of the \"Third World\" has gone through several intellectual phases. The first generation of scholars viewed the process somewhat optimistically as the global extension of modernity. Neo-Marxist critics tried to locate Third World underdevelopment in the history of colonialism and in the persistence of structures of dependency of Third World countries. \"Post-development\" theorists took on the idea of development itself. Globalization and the emergence of a new international division of labor, has reframed the debates. Developing countries like Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico and South Africa are now members of the G-20 group of countries, which many see as a likely successor to the G8 group of leading industrial economies. After reading representative authors of competing theoretical traditions, we will move on to concrete cases. This segment will be shaped partly by student interest. The course is meant as an Upper College seminar for students with some prior background in issues of development (through PS 222: Political Economy, or other courses).

        "description": "In January 2018 the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists moved its iconic Doomsday Clock to two minutes to midnight, reflecting the group\u2019s \"grim assessment\" that in the current political moment the danger of a nuclear catastrophe is as high as it was during the height of the Cold War. Indeed, with the possibility of nuclear war on the Korean peninsula, the emergence of a new nuclear arms race between the United States and Russia and the appearance of new nuclear powers, the proliferation of nuclear weapons has become an increasingly urgent threat to global security. This seminar will critically examine the problem of nuclear proliferation. Topics addressed include: How does the nuclear nonproliferation regime incentivize and discourage the pursuit of nuclear weapons? Why are some states' nuclear arsenals considered instruments of international security whereas others\u2019 nuclear ambitions are the source of instability in the system? Why are only some of the insecurities generated by the existence and proliferation of nuclear weapons conceptualized as threats to national security? How has the development and proliferation of nuclear weapons shaped the ways we understand what constitutes national security in the first place? Is global zero, a world without nuclear weapons, possible? In answering these questions we will consider nuclear proliferation as a material, social and cultural phenomenon that structures the international and domestic spheres and with this in mind develop an informed view of the various policy tools available to manage the spread of nuclear weapons. This course is reading intensive and students will complete a significant research paper related to the themes of the course. Class size: 15",

We begin with an exploration of the so-called \"third wave of democratization,\" the explosion of democratic transitions which brought democracy to some three-dozen nations between 1974 and 1992. It was capped by the collapse of Communism, an event heralded in some quarters as signaling \"the end of history.\" This section capitalizes upon a wide range of post-war theories of democratization, such as transitology, modernization, post-materialism, social capital, and diffusion. We will then examine the uneven legacy of the spread of democracy across Latin America, post-Communist Russia and Eastern Europe, and the Arab World, and the factors contributing to this legacy--from persistent poverty and inequality, to the rise of illiberal political cultures, to tepid support by the international community. We conclude by examining the challenges to democracy in the developed West, especially the rise of right-wing populism across Western Europe and in the U.S. With permission from the instructor, this class can be taken as a pre-moderation requirement in lieu of Introduction to Comparative Politics.

At the same time, the assumption that the People govern the United States has informed political life. Balancing the interests of the one against the many has therefore emerged as an important theme within American political thought. Writers and political thinkers engaging with American politics have sometimes extolled the virtues of the individual and sought to protect the individual from the \"threat\" of the masses; at other times the individual has been presented by commentators as a threat to the People\u2019s authority. This course seeks to examine the ways in which the concept of the individual has informed thinking about American Democracy and vice-versa, each appearing at different times as an assumption of, an aim for, and a threat to the other.

What kinds of material practices of fabrication, display, decoration, and ritual treatment are suitable for the divine bodies of gods? In many religious traditions, gods and goddesses are visible beings who present themselves to their devotees in visions, in icons, and in grand image-filled temples. Other religious traditions, by contrast, have often considered the embodiment of God in material form as deeply problematic or as a sacrilege. This course examines the practices, issues, and debates surrounding divine icons and the religious arts in a comparative perspective. In a larger sense, it seeks to investigate the role of the visual in religion. We will explore a series of examples, from the earliest recorded image practices of ancient Mesopotamia up to contemporary icons, popular posters, and visual rituals in Hinduism and Catholicism.

Is alchemy a scientific pursuit or a religious or spiritual one? This Big Ideas course provides a multifaceted exploration of the history of alchemy in thought, practice and art. Isaac Newton, an active alchemist, translated the Latin text that set out his own basic conviction: \"That which is below is like that which is above & that which is above is like that which is below.\" Alchemy asserts that all elements and forces of the universe are related, and that human beings are capable of understanding and influencing their relationship to one another. One result was the now famous quest to turn ordinary metals into gold. But alchemy during the several thousand years of its history has been applied in many different ways. It has embraced fundamental philosophical currents, contributing distinctive worldviews that remain current in global culture. Alchemy has always been intimately related to artistic practice and this class will provide a survey of works pertaining to alchemical processes ranging from medieval manuscripts to the modern era, from Surrealism to the latest contemporary art. There will be a number of film screenings and guest lectures associated with the course, i.e. from the History of Science, a modern-day practitioner of alchemy, contemporary artists, and others. Course requirements will include a number of research papers corresponding to the various components of the class. Class size: 25",

        "department": "socstudies",
        "description": "Cross-listed: Human Rights It has now been more than fifty years since the original work of Stanley Milgram demonstrated the remarkable and very widely unpredicted and unexpected finding that large numbers of individuals in multiple samples of American men and women studied were willing to \"punish\" another person when ordered to do so by an experimenter; this in the stated but false context of a psychology experiment on learning and memory. The prominence of the initial work and the continued salience of such study and accumulated findings in the domain of social psychology cannot be over-stated. And it very much has not reached the stage of dormancy as the publication of studies, literature reviews and conferences on the topic of obedience to authority continue to appear in unabated fashion. It is even the case that as recently as six years ago a replication of the original study, with slight modifications, and with concordant results was published (J. Burger, January 2009). Further revealing of prominence is that fact that a relatively new full-length movie version of the original study (a biopic) appeared this year. In addition, a diligent search of current psychology or cross-disciplinary archives uncovers further studies that provide evidence that obedience and indeed destructive obedience is very much prevalent in our society and in many others as well and in a myriad of contexts. The domain of the \"Milgram study\" is especially worthy of continuing interest. This because of the vastness of both criticism and praise of the original work but also because of historical and significant events in the intervening years between 1960s and stretching to our current time. The continuing study of obedience is vital for the betterment of institutions, even in a democratic society. Social scientists should and must find a way to safely and ethically investigate the conditions that promote destructive obedience and thereby begin to learn the rudiments of how such can be minimized. This is a college seminar. It is not limited to psychology or social studies or for that matter majors in any particular discipline. The two criteria for membership are a willingness to read with care and then with conviction share with others the results of such reading and study. Over the course of the semester a sizable portion of the work contained in the body of the obedience literature is reviewed. Admission by permission of the instructor. Class size: 10",

Sociologists study topics as varied as race, gender, class, religion, the birth of capitalism, democracy, education, crime and prisons, the environment, and inequality. At its most basic, the course will teach students how to read social science texts and evaluate their arguments. Conceptually, students will learn basic sociological themes and become familiar with how sociologists ask and answer questions. Most importantly, students will come away from the course with a new understanding of how to think sociologically about the world around them, their position in society, and how their actions both affect and are affected by the social structures in which we all live.

What are the sources of this inequality? Is social inequality inevitable? Is it undesirable? Through lectures, documentary films and class discussions, this course examines the ways by which socially-defined class, gender, race and ethnic categories are unevenly rewarded for their social contributions. Sociological theories are used to explain how and why social inequality is produced and maintained, and how it affects the well-being of individuals and social groups. The course will focus on two general themes. The first deals with the structure of inequality while studying the unequal distribution of material and social resources (e.g., social status, wealth, power). The second examines the processes that determine the allocation of people to positions in the stratification system (e.g. educational attainment, social capital, parental wealth, institutional discrimination).

In the first, we will learn how to formulate research questions and hypotheses, how to choose the appropriate research method for the problem, and how to maximize chances for valid and reliable findings. In the second part, we will learn how to perform simple data analysis and how to interpret and present findings in a written report. For a final paper, students use data from the U.S. General Social Survey (GSS) to study public attitudes toward issues such as abortion, immigration, inequality and welfare, affirmative action, gender roles, religion, the media, and gun laws.

The amount and type of punishment found in society is not a simple, direct result of crime patterns. Rather, to understand how and why we punish, we must examine the ways that historical processes, social structures, institutions, and culture shape penal practices as well as how systems of punishment shape society. This course draws on sociological and historical research to explore the social functions of punishment, its cultural foundations and meanings, what drives changes in how we punish, the relationship between penal practices and state power, and the role of crime control in reproducing race, gender, and class inequality. The class also delves deeply into the theoretical and empirical debates about the punitive turn in American criminal justice over the last 4 decades. We consider the causes and consequences of mass incarceration, the racial disparities in the system, the drug war, changes in policing, the politicization of crime, and the role of criminal justice in the welfare state.

We consider why/how patterns of sexuality have changed over time, how the social control of sex operates, and how new categories of sexuality emerge. We ask how people use sexuality to define themselves, reinforce social hierarchies, mark moral boundaries, and produce communities. The course begins with an introduction to theories of sexuality, including the essentialist-constructionist debate, the relationship of gender and sexuality, and the role of power. We unpack these theoretical questions through the history of sexuality in the United States. The course pays special attention to the role of gender, race, and class; to changing economic structures; and to the influence of medicine, the state, and popular culture.

Each week we will \"theorize\" social media from a different perspective, seeking new sociological insights into social media-related \"spaces,\" and into the ways that morality, ethics, and politics are enacted within such spaces. After initially situating one technological platform for social media (Facebook) in its historical and legal context, we will expand our inquiry and seek answers to the following types of questions. What are social networks, and how do they work? How do the technical controls (e.g. friend suggestions) and institutional frameworks (e.g. corporate business models and intellectual property laws) of social media impact qualities and characteristics of social interaction? How might this matter for social movements relying on social media? Do social relationships and communities work differently, when they are formed through social media? How might we affect normative orders of truth-telling and justice in the ways that we use (or don\u2019t use) social media? Note: This course is part of the Courage to Be College Seminar, affiliated with the Hannah Arendt Center. Students will be required to attend three evening lectures.

Students may take either semester or both. The first semester examines painting, sculpture, architecture, and other artifacts from the Paleolithic period through the 14th century. Works from Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas are studied chronologically to create an integrated historical context. Readings from various critical perspectives present different methodological approaches. Requirements include two papers, a mid-term, a final, and quizzes. This course fulfills one requirement for moderating into Art History; potential majors are urged to take Perspectives prior to other Art History classes. Open to all students. Class size: 25",

In addition to sculpture, masks, architecture and metalwork, we will examine beadwork, textiles, jewelry, house painting, pottery, and other decorative arts. Some of the topics to be explored will be implements of divination, royal regalia, the role of performance, music and dance, funerary practices, and the incorporation of western motifs and materials. Because art and visual culture most deeply reveal the aesthetic, spiritual and social values of a people, this course fulfills the Rethinking Difference requirement. We will examine the ways in which objects, performances, regalia and other forms designed for visual consumption work together in African societies to create a cohesive sense of identity and belonging to community members.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Human Rights; Photography;Science, Technology & Society. In the decades after World War II, photography\u2019s social and artistic roles changed in many ways. The 1950s saw the dominance of magazine photography in Life and Lookand witnessed the birth of a more personal photographic culture, exemplified by Robert Frank\u2019s book The Americans. In the 1960s and 1970s, photographers such as Diane Arbus, Garry Winogrand, and Lee Friedlander created a new view of contemporary life from moments gathered in the streets and from private lives. Beginning in the late 70s, artists trained outside of traditional photography began to employ the camera for wholly different purposes, using photography to pose ideological questions about images and image-making in a media-saturated culture. Today, the transformation of photography through digital technology has again thrown the meaning(s) of photographically-derived images into question. This lecture/discussion class will cover the historical context of this period and tease out fundamental issues of photography and its ostensible nature and the politics of representation. Student performance will be evaluated in class discussion, exams, and papers. No prerequisites, but preference will be given to moderated photography and moderated art history students.

In addition to conventional churches, statuary and paintings, we will examine folk art traditions such as popular saints and cults, masked performances, and shamanic beliefs tied to healing. A significant portion of the course will deal with African diasporic religions such as Candomble and Santera as practiced in Brazil, the Caribbean and the United States.

We will focus primarily on art produced in northern Europe, using select case studies including Bosch, Holbein, Vermeer, Rembrandt and Rubens to examine the following questions: How do art historians and critics translate older works of art, many of which seem unfamiliar or strange, for the public? How do scholars and critics distill complex academic arguments into appealing, accessible prose? What types of academic art history texts, focused on early modern work, are reviewed in popular forums? How does one write about early modern art within a journal\u2014such as ArtForum\u2014dedicated primarily to contemporary art? In what ways do museums use language in the form of catalogues, wall text, and online platforms to engage audiences? In addition to these questions, we will consider the role the internet has played in introducing new constituencies to works produced in our period, and analyze how critical writing helps determine the market for art. Because this is a writing-intensive course, students should be prepared to do weekly writing or peer editing. Primarily for moderated art history students. Primarily for moderated art history majors. Art History Distribution: 1400-1800, Europe. The Calderwood Seminars are intended primarily for junior and senior majors in the field (or in some cases affiliated fields--check with the faculty member if you are unsure). They are designed to help students think about how to translate their discipline (e.g. art history, biology, literature) to non-specialists through different forms of public writing. Depending on the major, public writing might include policy papers, book reviews, blog posts, exhibition catalog entries, grant reports, or editorials. Students will be expected to write or edit one short piece of writing per week. Class size: 12",

In this one credit movement practice class, students will learn how to use the principles of the Alexander Technique to access ease and freedom in both movement and stillness. We will look at movement in terms of personal choice and presence. Through floor exercises, standing work and game structures, we will explore how habitual patterns of thought and movement are intimately connected and how they can be noticed, addressed, and shifted in order to support our three dimensional body. This course is good for both experienced movers and non-dancers alike. No dance experience required. ",

We will visit locations to observe and shoot and also, when in the classroom, study the history of landscape as expressed by painters, writers, video artists and filmmakers. We will consider environmental issues, the social uses of land and parks, travel and tourism and more generally, the politics of place. A broad range of tools and techniques will be introduced, such as: panoramas, mapping, image archives, drones, creative geography, 360 degree cams and others. Students are required to complete short videos every couple of weeks in response to local site visits and regular attendance is mandatory. Our travels will involve time outside of class, so please be flexible. Class size: 12",

A special emphasis will be placed on those artists whose work presents a particular challenge to or innovation in narrative form per se, to the extent that as they approach a kind of visual poetry, they place difficult demands upon the viewer to be a creative collaborator. The list of film screenings may be augmented or altered by current releases in the fall, or student interest as the course progresses, but it will certainly include films by the following: Jim Jarmusch, David Lynch, Abbas Kiarostami, Aleksandr Sokurov, Peggy Ahwesh, Claire Denis, Guy Maddin, Hou Hsaio-hsien, Michael Haneke, Lars von Trier, Peter Greenaway and Chantal Akerman. Two written projects: one short and one long. Limited course enrollment: Juniors and Seniors only; preference will be given to those students with background in film criticism and history.

        "description": "A tutorial devoted to the major theories of film from the so-called \"classical period\" (largely the first half of the twentieth century), when both critics and writer/filmmakers were manifestly trying to establish a groundwork for how to think of the relatively new medium of cinema as an expressive form worthy by itself of serious consideration among its more established sister arts. Class discussions will primarily evolve from close readings of sometimes highly complex aesthetic arguments that think through the properties of the medium. We will scrutinize the answers to various questions such as: Can what is deemed \"cinematic\" ever be isolated from other art forms? Can film be thought of as constituting a language? Brief, select film screenings will support our understanding of the written texts. A number of readings will offer a more general philosophical questioning of the nature of art itself, since cinema seems to invite speculation that technology and modern consciousness may have brought dramatically new pressures to bear on aesthetic thinking. Writers to be discussed include C. S. Peirce, Benedetto Croce, Ferdinand de Saussure, Hugo Munsterberg, Erwin Panofsky, Sergei Eisenstein, Rudolf Arnheim, Siefried Kracauer, Maya Deren, Stan Brakhage, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Hollis Frampton, Andrei Tarkovsky, Laura Mulvey, Walter Benjamin, Andre Bazin, Susan Sontag, Gilles Deleuze, Umberto Eco, Christian Metz, et al. A required short mid-term essay (a practice piece) and an extended written term project. Short screenings at most classes. Class size: 15",

The semester includes a short historical survey of Blues and of Jazz from Ragtime to the Swing era as part of the effort to understand the practice of the technical/aesthetic fundamentals specific to Jazz as a 20th-century African American music including an introduction to the contribution of female musicians to the Jazz legacy. There is an ear-training component to this course. The melodic component includes singing the basic 20th-century harmonic materials, Blues melodies and transcriptions of solos by Jazz masters. It includes the practice of the syncopated rhythmic language underlying linear melodic phrasing. This course fulfills a music theory/performance requirement for music majors. Required course for moderating into the Jazz program. Class size: 22",

Through our exploration of the materiality and meaning of music, we will listen to wide-ranging examples of sounds from around the globe. We will consider ways to listen deeply and to write critically about music. We will examine how music has been represented in the past and how it is variously represented today, and will develop ethnographic research and writing skills. We will ask questions about the utility and value of music as a commodity in our everyday lives and in our globalized world. We will debate the ethics of musical appropriations and collaborations. We will examine both the foundational questions of the discipline (addressing debates about musical authenticity, musical origins, universals, comparative frameworks, and the preservationist ethos) as well as recent subjects of ethnomusicological concern. Topics will include: media and technology; post-colonial issues; music and language; hybridity; circulation and consumption; music and labor; music and gender; and the relevance of music to contemporary indigenous politics and human rights.

Gender and sexuality played a crucial role in these identities, and were often quite fluid: there were men playing women\u2019s parts, women dressed as men, women dressed as men dressed as women, and countless plots and subplots with homoerotic overtones. This course explores the construction of gender and sexuality in early Italian opera, from the very first productions at the beginning of the seventeenth century through the end of the eighteenth century. We will focus on castrati\u2014castrated male singers\u2014as well as the complex characterization of women and female desire in various productions. Operas will include Claudio Monteverdi\u2019s L\u2019Orfeo, Francesco Cavalli\u2019s La Calisto, George Frideric Handel\u2019s Giulio Cesare, and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\u2019s Le nozze di Figaro. Through secondary readings from gender and queer theory, we will delve into the rich questions of subjectivity and identity in early opera. Class size: 22",

We will cover basic software and digital equipment by designing a series of versatile, studio driven images and sculptures on each piece of equipment in the Studio Arts digital lab and woodshop\u2014taking the work from physical to digital and back again. Students will learn basic Adobe Creative Suite programs: Photoshop and Illustrator, along with open source 3D modelling software. Projects designed with these software programs will manifest physically through the use of industry standard equipment such as laser cutting, 3D printing, 3D scanning, digital printing and CNC available in our digital lab. Today, digital machines do not simply produce images and information; they produce subjects and govern ways of existing. No prior digital knowledge is necessary. Open only to Art Majors.

As inspiration we will look at the ways that human intervention has transformed our physical world world through garden design, suburban sprawl, urban grids, mining sites, managed forests, zoos, constructed waterways and earthworks. In addition, we will survey a range of contemporary artists who are wrestling with the human impact on our biosphere. Coursework will foster a body of work consisting of on-line sketchbooks, site-specific installation, digital collage, gifs, large scale printing and laser cutting. These projects will emerge out of a series of exercises that will build image making skills and establish a digital workflow. Class size: 12",

The students pursue assignments that focus their attention on issues such as value contrast, warm and cool contrast, creating tonality, understanding the expressive and structural possibilities of the materiality of paint, as well as how all of these elements factor in the composition of form and space. The projects are sequenced in a way that the students move from a simple dialogue of light and dark and gradually begin to incorporate a fuller range of elements from the vocabulary of painting during the semester. Assignments are designed to promote a recognition that expression in painting is rooted in its form \u2013 color, light, materiality, composition, etc. While much of the work will be done from observation - still life, landscape (weather permitting) and model - there will be assignments that incorporate abstraction as well.

Line, shape, value, gesture, perspective, volume, composition and space form essential drawing skills that create the basis for translating 3D into 2D.

Students will be working on gessoed paper over the first weeks but should know how to stretch and prime a canvas properly. Some of the poses will extend over two weeks, which will allow students to begin to push their work into new places. This class is for students who want to work hard and extend themselves.

You will explore different ways of building spatial relationships and investigating the mystery of forms and the unidentified pockets of space that connect and surround them. We will discuss light and air, weight, gravity, speed and tensions while addressing problems of scale and the potential power and pressure of how mark-making possibilities by using different materials (charcoal, pencils, cut paper, black and white acrylic paint) to create harmony that resonates throughout the composition. Great drawings and paintings of the past will be looked at",

Character masks introduce an element of psychology, which creates a new range of performance possibilities. Commedia dell\u2019Arte adds appetite and desire, leading students to archetype, extreme character, physical comedy and the creation of lazzi. Mask is a marriage of physical precision with emotional/psychological abandon. Students will learn mask technique on their feet and in their body, through structured improvisation in class. They will apply the principles that they have studies to create performances and character studies that will be performed in class and critiqued. Class size: 16",

Students will be taught to apply this broadened vocal pallet to the performance of text, discovering the possibilities available through both exploration and conscious shifts in the voice and body.

        "description": "Where should a study of theater begin, and how did pre-modern models of theater change, as successive societies revised, rejected, and appropriated the forms that had gone before? This course will investigate selected periods in world theater, beginning with the massive communal festivals of ancient Greece and culminating in the philosophical upheavals of the Enlightenment. Paying close attention to connections between drama, stagecraft, and modes of spectatorship, we will ask how the theater has shored up political power; how the stage has served as a scale model for the known world; and what has been at stake in changing notions of classicism. Through analytical essays, class presentations, and a final performance project, we will cultivate a critical vocabulary for discussing theaters of the past\u2014and discover their often-surprising legacies in modern and contemporary performance. Priority will be given to intended Theater & Performance majors. Class size: 22",

This course will investigate that century, tracing the European and American theatrical avant-gardes from 1909 to 1995, including movements and artists such as Expressionism, Surrealism and Dada; John Cage, Allan Kaprow, and Happenings; utopian collectives of the 1960s; Peter Handke, Heiner M\u00fcller, the Wooster Group and Reza Abdoh. We will explore questions including: the implications of assuming the mantle of the \"avant-garde\"; the contested status of the dramatic text in avant-garde performance; the relationship between performance and emerging media forms; and avant-garde artists\u2019 efforts to create radical fusions of art and life.

From the earlier period, we will examine the texts and performers that evolved into a theater that protested the society that evolved under Apartheid from playwrights such as Athol Fugard to theater makers such as the Junction Avenue Theatre Company, Mbongeni Ngema, Percy Mtwa, and Barney Simon to performers such as Pieter-Dirk Uys and John Kani. We will then look at how theater artists evolved to articulate the complexity of the post-Apartheid era. We will examine the work of writers such as Mike Van Graan, Mpumelelo Paul Grootboom, Zakes Mda, Reza de Wet and Aubrey Sekhabi, and theater makers such as Brett Bailey, Lara Foot, Yael Farber and William Kentridge with the Handspring Puppet Company.

The semester begins with an overview of the impact of gender coding and \"type-casting\"; where and how theater, television, and film have accepted or refused the categorical branding of identity. Through improvisation and performance exercises, students will examine overt and covert societal rules surrounding the gender binary, and discover how the tools of drag, neo-camp, and hyperbole can enhance and/or subvert the performance of gender.

To what extent does such a work represent the general culture out of which it emerged, and to what extent does it reflect an individual consciousness? How does our assumption of who the author is affect how our reading of the text? We will be keeping these questions in mind as we examine the shift in medieval and Renaissance literature from epic to lyric and romance; from orally-based literature to written texts; and from anonymous poets to professional writers. Texts to be read will include The Song of Roland, troubadour lyrics, Arthurian romances, The Romance of the Rose, Dante's Inferno, Petrarch\u2019s sonnets, Boccaccio\u2019s Decameron, Christine de Pizan's Book of the City of Ladies, and Francois Villon's Testament.

That power, diffused into the lives of individual Americans by technological, political, and social change, simultaneously deepened a sense of powerlessness for some and fulfilled hopes and expectations for others: if you imaginatively identified with the nation and its privileged symbols\u2014for example, whiteness, masculinity, weaponry, and material plenty\u2014would you experience the promised sense of centrality and significance seemingly mandated by our military triumph, our wealth, our extraordinary global prestige, and our historical sense of providential destiny? Or would you experience, or even be aware of, America\u2019s failure to deliver on its promises? In this course, we will be looking at the ways in which American literature imagined and represented what it was like to live American lives between August 6, 1945, and September 11, 2001, the day when American verities and pieties underwent a sudden reckoning. We will begin by asking ourselves and our writers the same question with which R.W. Emerson opens his great essay, Experience:Where do we find ourselves? and go on to examine works by mid-to late twentieth-century and contemporary writers of fiction, nonfiction, drama, and poetry. Moreover we shall do so through explicit reference to traditions and problems bequeathed to us by American writing from the seventeenth-century on. Can we still see ourselves as the City on a Hill? What has happened to the democratic faith of Emerson and Whitman? Do we possess a \"usable past\"? Is ours a society marked by \"quiet desperation\"? Readings vary each time the course is given; some covered authors have been John Hersey, Tennessee Williams, Allen Ginsberg, Norman Mailer, James Baldwin, Philip Roth, Joan Didion, Toni Morrison and Junot Diaz, among others.

        "department": "worldlit",
        "description": "Cross-listed: Human Rights; Jewish Studies; Russian Studies Class size:\n22 Isaac Babel (1894-1940) was one of the most perplexing geniuses of twentieth century Russian and European literature. Babel enlisted as a Jew in the famously anti-Semitic Cossack division of the Red Cavalry in 1920 and soon thereafter became one of the most famous writers in Soviet Russia; he escaped the fury of the Great Terror of 1937-38 only to be arrested in the spring of 1939 and shot as a traitor in 1940. The sum total of his writings was meager in comparison with that of most of his contemporaries; his political ambiguities are frequently infuriating; his defiant ironies often without clear target; his captivating literary style a puzzle of images and absences. He spoke of himself as \"the master of the genre of silence.\" In this class, we will attempt to unravel some of his many paradoxes through close readings of his masterpiece Red Cavalry, the 1920 Diary and The Odessa Stories. Background critical and historical texts, such as writings by Leon Trotsky, A. K. Voronsky, Vladimir Mayakovsky and pronouncements and documents of the Soviet government will provide a framework for understanding Babel\u2019s struggle as both Jew and Russian, as both a writer deeply imbued with the spirit of western humanism and one committed to the triumph of the Bolshevik Revolution, and as both an incessant prankster and reflective spiritual vagabond. This class will examine his many attempts at finding a literary center that resolves the radical contradictions between his relation to tradition and to the growing nightmare of Soviet reality. This course is part of the World Literature offering. Class size: 20",

We will read it with slow care, studying its artistry at the level of the sentence while also addressing its most leviathanic themes: authoritarianism, economy, religion, race, disability, sexuality, and ecology. At the same time, we will track its influence across later historical moments and other artistic media, looking at works of poetry, sculpture, theater, science fiction, critical theory, animation, and popular music -- works that engage with Moby-Dick either by adapting it, echoing it, or critiquing it. What is it about this novel, which flopped when first published, that has resonated in such varied aesthetic and social contexts over the last century and a half? And what might Captain Ahab\u2019s whale-hunt mean today? Finding answers to these questions will bring us to Elizabeth Bishop, Ralph Ellison, Donna Haraway, C. L. R. James, Toni Morrison, Frank Stella, Orson Welles, and others. Class size: 22",

        "department": "lit2courses",
        "description": "2 credits It is 2018. Why aren't there more women in leadership positions? According to a 2014 Pew Research Center report, the majority of American men and women acknowledge the capacity of women to lead. Yet in certain domains--most notably politics and business--women continue to be under-represented at the top. Recent elections have galvanized the electorate around constructions of gender in particularly dramatic ways. If we are living in a post-feminist society (as some claim), why do these questions and conflicts continue to arise? Identity is an urgent conversation in 21st-century politics and everyday life, and this includes awareness of how intersectionality shapes gendered experiences. What are the stories that we tell ourselves and each other about equality, representation, privilege, freedom, authority, and success? How do these inflect real-world outcomes for individuals and societies? In this two-credit course we will explore some of the stories that circulate in our culture around women and power, both from an academic and from a practical, real-world perspective. What does it mean to lead? How do we use a language of empowerment? Why has the United States embraced certain narratives of gender equity and success as opposed to those being created in other countries and cultures? We will focus on learning from women who are committed to making a difference in the world through their personal and professional choices, hearing their stories, and reading texts that have been particularly important to them in their lives and work. So too, we will engage with stories from the past (archival research), from across disciplines (the military, higher education, STEM, the arts, tech, media) and from a wide range of perspectives. As an Engaged Liberal Arts and Sciences course, this seminar will provide students with the unique opportunity to bring theory and practice together in a very immediate sense: by the end of the term you will have identified a story only you can tell, whether it is based in political activism, community engagement, or work experience. Drawing on the rich resources here in Annandale as well as through Bard's other campuses (Simon's Rock, Holyoke Microcollege) we will reach out to groups and organizations with a shared focus on gender. Network building is something we will explicitly address and we will convene for a Summit late in the semester. This course is open to all first-year students. Upper College students may also participate if selected to serve as course fellows. Class size: 20",

To gain a fuller appreciation of the variety, complexity, and dramatic fascination of Goethe's Faust, we will also consider Faust literature before and after Goethe and explore the integration of Faust in music, theater, and film (e.g., Marlowe\u2019s tragedy Doctor Faustus, Arrigo Boito's opera Mefistofele, Friedrich W.

In this course, we will explore the works of this \"other\" Romantic tradition while taking into account the ways in which political issues and social mores shape a body of literature and mediate its status in the marketplace. We will also question conventional understandings of British Romanticism itself, challenging assumptions about its historical, aesthetic, political, and philosophical characteristics.

In this course, we will explore the myriad ways in which this process and the urban space it has created has been written and represented. We will ask how artists attempt to express and make sense of the shifting field of sensation and information that constitutes city life in modern Japan. We will also examine questions of what is lost in the rural to urban transition and problems of nostalgia and alienation in the countryside and new suburbs. The course explores how the experiences and emotions germane to metropolitan life can be expressed, communicated, and understood through literature, film, photography, music, manga, maps, and more.

Auden, the very malaises of modernity\u2014alienated individuality, the cold grip of impersonal law\u2014also make modernity a fertile ground for the comic imagination. In this course we will explore comedy as both aesthetic form and philosophical anthropology. Does the comic imagination reinforce social hierarchies by marking certain figures as socially and morally inferior, or are its energies more egalitarian, as when it emphasizes our shared condition of embodiment and sympathizes with our finitude and frailty? Is comedy conservative, as when it eviscerates utopian fantasies, or radical in its capacity to expose social mores, taboos, and gender norms as ridiculous or arbitrary? We will engage multiple theorists of the comic, from Charles Baudelaire and S\u00f6ren Kierkegaard to Susan Sontag and Stanley Cavell, and try to explicate their divergent claims: is comedy \"Satanic\" or \"religious,\" nihilistic or affirmative? After a brief look at pre-modern comedy we will explore how twentieth-century (principally Anglophone) writers repurpose comic methods and attitudes. Along the way we will identify different moods, genres and perspectives within comedy, such as satire, irony, grotesque, slapstick, camp and farce. Texts will likely include V.S.

This course will focus on a wide range of fictions, from a variety of writers with different backgrounds, that tell unusual stories about the rights of individuals and communities to justice. We will read novels addressing human migration, injustices committed in the name of the state against a minority, and the harsh conditions under which some communities operate as part of their survival strategy, among other topics. We will look at the ways in which literary forms can allow universalizing claims to be made, exploring how racism, disenfranchisement, poverty, and lack of access to education and health care, for instance, can affect the dignity of all humans. Readings may include: Chronicles of a Death Foretold by Garcia Marquez; Snow Falling on Cedars by David Guterson; Smilla\u2019s Sense of Snow by Peter Hoeg; Our Nig by Harriet Wilson; Balzac & the Chinese Seamstress by Sijai Dai; Winter is in the Blood by James Welch; The Way to Rainy Mountain by N. Scott Momaday; Wolves of the Crescent Moon by Yousef Al-Mohaimeed, and Bound to Violence by Yambo\nOuleguem. We will also watch a number of films based on the novels (including Chronicles, Smilla's Sense, Balzac, Snow Falling), and The First Grader (2001, on the right to education in Kenya).

        "description": "Cross-listed: Human Rights; Jewish Studies; Russian Studies Isaac Babel (1894-1940) was one of the most perplexing geniuses of twentieth century Russian and European literature. Babel enlisted as a Jew in the famously anti-Semitic Cossack division of the Red Cavalry in 1920 and soon thereafter became one of the most famous writers in Soviet Russia; he escaped the fury of the Great Terror of 1937-38 only to be arrested in the spring of 1939 and shot as a traitor in 1940. The sum total of his writings was meager in comparison with that of most of his contemporaries; his political ambiguities are frequently infuriating; his defiant ironies often without clear target; his captivating literary style a puzzle of images and absences. He spoke of himself as \"the master of the genre of silence.\" In this class, we will attempt to unravel some of his many paradoxes through close readings of his masterpiece Red Cavalry, the 1920 Diary and The Odessa Stories. Background critical and historical texts, such as writings by Leon Trotsky, A. K. Voronsky, Vladimir Mayakovsky and pronouncements and documents of the Soviet government will provide a framework for understanding Babel\u2019s struggle as both Jew and Russian, as both a writer deeply imbued with the spirit of western humanism and one committed to the triumph of the Bolshevik Revolution, and as both an incessant prankster and reflective spiritual vagabond. This class will examine his many attempts at finding a literary center that resolves the radical contradictions between his relation to tradition and to the growing nightmare of Soviet reality. This course is part of the World Literature offering. Class size: 22",

Our exploration will stretch from Rabelais, in the sixteenth century, to Thomas Mann, Jean-Paul Sartre and Iris Murdoch in the twentieth, with stops in between for Laurence Sterne and Voltaire and Denis Diderot. Throughout we will focus on what this tradition can tell us about what the novel is, what it became -- and what it can be. Workload for this special seminar will consist of reading roughly two books a month and handing in a short paper on each. ",

        "description": "The great American novelist Henry James (1843-1916) marks the seminal transition from nineteenth century realism\u2019s preoccupation with marriage, money, manners and morals to the first fully formed experiments in modernist fiction, with its obsessive interest in the representation of the processes of consciousness as the stuff of experience, conflict and drama. We will examine major works from every phase of James\u2019s singular career, including The American (1877), Daisy Miller (1879), The Portrait of a Lady (1881), and such important late works as The Wings of the Dove (1902) and The Ambassadors (1903), in addition to the novellas The Beast in the Jungle (1903) and The Turn of the Screw (1898). We will look not only at such essential Jamesian subjects as Americans in Europe, and the dangers of both self-deception and sexuality, but also, through James's prefaces, the way he developed and articulated his theory of the novel as high art.

The New York School of poetry, named after its famed counterpart in visual arts, drew an eclectic group, including Frank O\u2019Hara, John Ashbery, Barbara Guest, Kenneth Koch, Leroy Jones (Amiri Baraka) and James Schuyler. Almost all of these poets were engaged with and wrote about other arts, especially painting. A second generation, centered around the Saint Marks Poetry Project, will be considered, including Ted Berrigan, Alice Notley, Ron Padgett, Joe Brainard and Anne Waldman. In this course, we will ask how the urban environment affects ideas of narrativity, community, domesticity, nature and place in a poetics of the city.

In so doing, they provide powerful and insightful renditions of the institution of slavery and its impact not only on the enslaved but the enslavers as well. By weaving in various critical essays that examine constructions of race as they relates to power, control, and the law, we will grapple with the realities of crafted identities. The larger challenge is to arrive at a more complex understanding of the history of slavery and race in America via historical fiction and to have painful yet necessary conversations about how these ideas impact our lives. We will read texts [short stories, novels, essays] by Maryse Conde (Guadeloupe), Fred D\u2019Aguiar (Guyana), Caryl Phillips (St. Kitts), James Baldwin (New York, USA), Richard Dyer (England), Ian F.

This course explores the relationship between literature and rebellion in early modern England. From scatological verse libel to subversive autobiography to popular tragedy, English literature challenged the social, religious, and political norms of the day. Through literature, marginalized individuals and groups\u2014including women, religious dissidents, and commoners\u2014made their voices heard. Why and how did literature become a form of resistance? How did early modern writers imagine and perform dissent? Our inquiry will begin with controversial poetry and prose, from Elizabethan libel to Milton\u2019s divorce tracts. We will then study how women like Aemilia\nLanyer and Margaret Cavendish crafted radically public personae in print. In our final unit, we will examine the varieties of rebellion in plays by Shakespeare and Marlowe. Throughout, we will read these literary works in dialogue with selected texts of social and political theory, both early modern and modern. Class size: 15",

        "description": "This Calderwood Seminar in Literature will examine the culturally significant literary works that are being produced in the United States today. We will discuss, analyze, and consider these works both for their literary merit and their social impact. Students will be expected to produce a body of writing in the style of the \"public intellectual,\" the critic or commentator who is able to communicate her ideas\u2014even complex ones\u2014in an accessible style geared for the general reader (i.e., without academic jargon). Our goal will be to develop the tools of cultural commentary and literary analysis that will enable students to take part in the broader cultural conversation. Assignments will include book reviews in the style of the New Yorker, New York Review of Books, New York Times Book Review, Bookforum, London Review of Books, TLS, and other such publications (especially through essays, reviews, and \"thought\" pieces); a profile of an author, including an interview; and studies of contemporary American readership and literary culture. As part of their assignments, students will maintain a weekly blog that will serve as both a record of their engagement with the course material and an archive for their work. Authors we will discuss are likely to include Jonathan Franzen, Jhumpa Lahiri, Claudia Rankine, Adelle Waldman, Leslie Jamison, Dave Eggers, and many others. Weekly meetings will include discussion of the particular book or work under review; workshops of student work; and analysis of individual authors as well as consideration of the broad cultural trends related to the reception of their work. The Calderwood Seminars are designed primarily for junior and senior majors in the field (or in some cases affiliated fields-- check with the faculty member if you are unsure). They are designed to help students think about how to translate their discipline (e.g. art history, biology, literature) to non-specialists through different forms of public writing. Depending on the major, public writing might include policy papers, book reviews, blog posts, exhibition catalog entries, grant reports, or editorials. Students will be expected to write or edit one short piece of writing per week. Class size: 12",

In this course we will closely examine a variety of short texts in order to investigate such questions, and to think about the different roles a reader might assume in order to productively receive a \"difficult\" or \"easy\" text: decoder, technician, philologist, ideologue, initiate, psychoanalyst, aesthete, and so forth. In this way, we will lay a foundation for literary theory and develop strategies for engaging with writings that are often deemed to be too forbidding (or too simple) for our attention. Readings will include the Gospel of St. Mark and work by Thomas Browne, the Grimm brothers, James Joyce, Hermann Broch, Gertrude Stein, Sylvia Plath, Emmanuel Levinas, John Ashbery, Lydia Davis, the 9/11 Commission, Annie Dillard, and Arnold Lobel (author of the Frog and Toad books).

Artifice, rhetoric, plot, and especially fiction would seem to have no place in the conveyance of news and information. And who wants to read an informative poem? Journalism, by definition, belongs to the here and now, to the everyday (the 'jour' in journalism), while literary writing would seem to have higher aspirations. But sometimes journalism and literature converge. This course seeks to complicate the opposition between literature and reportage, fiction and fact, news and opinion, and explore what constitutes very fine writing at its most informative. Texts to be considered include various essays by Orwell, Buruma's Death in Amsterdam, Steinberg's Numbers, Baldwin's The Fire Next Time, Didion's The Year of Magical Thinking, Lindquist's Exterminate all the Brutes, Appiah's In My Father's House, Mendes's Bay of Tigers, and Boo's Behind the Beautiful Forevers.

A pragmatic focus on the nuts and bolts of the project will be complemented with life-after-Bard skills workshops, along with a review of internship and grant-writing opportunities in the discipline. Senior Colloquium is designed to create a productive network of association for student scholars and critics: small working groups foster intellectual community, providing individual writers with a wide range of support throughout this culminating year of undergraduate study in the major.

Over the course of the semester we will read from a broad range of classical and contemporary writers whose work is a deliberate hybrid of form, style, and genre. We will read essays that have the texture and imagination of a short story; stories that are closer to poems, journalists who use the tools common to fiction, and novelists whose work straddles the line between autobiography and fiction. Our reading for the semester will be based around broad, thematic concerns. We will discuss the relationship between form and content; the ethics of narration; and, ultimately, how we can apply the tools and techniques of the writers we\u2019ve read to our own creative and critical writing. This is a writing-intensive course. Students will be expected to write short, critical responses throughout the semester, as well as generate a substantial body of creative text. Class size: 14",

The primary purpose is to guide seniors, both practically and philosophically, in the daunting task of creating a coherent and inspired creative work of high quality within a single academic year. Emphasis is on demystifying the project process, including its bureaucratic hurdles, as well as exploring the role of research in the creative realm, and helping students use each other as a critical and inspirational resource during this protracted solitary endeavor, sharing works in progress when appropriate. This supplements but never supplants the primary and sacrosanct role of the project adviser. Program faculty and alumni/ae, career development and other staff, and outside speakers (such as editors, translators, MFA graduates and directors, publishing personnel, etc.) contribute their collective wisdom and experience, sharing the myriad ways in which writers move an idea toward full creative realization, and giving a glimpse of the kinds of internships and careers available to the writer. Required for students enrolled in a Written Arts Senior Project. All such students are enrolled automatically by the Registrar, and should not (cannot) register themselves manually for Colloquium.

Students will enlarge their speaking, reading, writing and comprehension skills in Modern Standard Arabic, the form of Arabic shared by all Arab countries. Classroom time is devoted to conversation (skits and discussions) and grammar exercises (including skim-reading tasks, spiraling and inference, analogy, problem solving, and educated guessing), stemming from the DVDs and other untainted materials. For example, in the course of the semester you will learn Arabic through a variety of musical traditions both classical and modern. The course will continue to introduce students to some Egyptian colloquial. Consistent emphasis is placed on authentic resources that derive from the most updated cultural contexts, realities and creative work of the Arab world such as gender issues, Arab-Muslim and Arab-Christian traditions, social clubs, ethnic groups, the role of the media etc. Students are expected to devote adequate time for homework, meet with a tutor every week to help them with homework and attend a session of Spoken Arabic.

We\u2019ll examine their writings from literary, historical, cultural, and political perspectives. Topics to be discussed include colonialism, empire building, modernity, economic development, cultural and artistic authenticity, and construction of self- and ethnic identity. While seeking to engage in conversations about modes of seeing the world and representations of the other, the course also aims to interrogate the impact of tourism on local communities and the concept of nature and its relationship to cultural space.

        "department": "classic",
        "description": "Cross-listed: Historical Studies; Literature At the end of the third century AD, the Roman Empire stretched from Spain to Asia Minor. It was so vast that its administration was divided into eastern and western zones. Two hundred years later, the Empire lost control of most of its western provinces. The events associated with these losses constitute the \"Fall of the Roman Empire.\" This course takes an interdisciplinary perspective (incorporating archaeological, scientific, and literary evidence) to explore the causes behind the collapse of the imperial structure, and to assess the afterlife of Roman culture in the \"Barbarian\" West through the seventh century. It will track not only how institutions of government and religion changed, but also how human imaginations, identities, values, and cultural commitments evolved in response to crisis and in the aftermath of empire. Readings (in English translation) will introduce students to historians (Gregory of Tours), poet-philosophers (Boethius), theologians (Augustine), and letter writers (Sidonius\nApollinaris) who reacted with astonishing self-awareness and creativity to their changing Roman worlds. By the end of the course, students will be equipped to produce historically sensitive close readings of late ancient texts, and to parse them with an eye toward categories of culture and identity. They can also expect to develop their own answers to one of ancient history\u2019s most vexing questions: did the fall of the Roman Empire signal \"the triumph of barbarism\" and the \"end of civilization,\" or did continuity prevail? No previous knowledge of Rome is assumed. Class size: 22",

From a variety of different perspectives, they all ask the question: why literature? How can literature serve as a response to a problem (be it personal or political), or, taken from another angle, why is the questioning at the heart of literature often seemingly the sole solution? This class will explore many of the ways in which, over the past three and a half centuries, literature has attempted to grasp its own essence. Readings from Diderot, Rousseau, Stendhal, Balzac, Nerval, Baudelaire, Mallarm\u00e9, Breton, Sartre and Duras (among others). Taught in French.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Literature For the last few decades in France, the \"call of the real\" (Forest) has presented itself to many writers as nothing less than an ethical imperative. Indeed, texts belonging to referential or \"factual\" literature have multiplied to such an extent that commentators \u2013 echoing Husserl\u2019s famous exhortation \u2013 have talked about a \"return to the real\" (Viart), as if literature, in its rejection of fiction, was vowing to immerse itself anew in the world. Thus Georges Perec attempts to describe the place Saint-Sulpice in Paris as faithfully as possible and to a point of \"exhaustion\"; Annie Ernaux, in her Journal du dehors, aims for a kind of \"photographic writing\", one that should be entirely objective; Philippe Vasset, in exploring the uncharted surroundings of Paris similarly hopes to write \"as close to the ground\" as possible. But how does one write the real? And what are the consequences of this drive for truth? How can one reconcile the desire to document, to bear witness to what is there or memorialize what is already vanishing, with the formal and aesthetic issues that are at the core of what we consider to be properly literary? Can one even distinguish unambiguously fact from fiction, truth from invention? And how is our very understanding of \"reading\" challenged by these accounts? These are a few of the questions that will structure our investigation, as we work through a selection of \"factographic\" writings \u2013 some recent, others less so \u2013, paying particular attention to texts concerned with space, with the urban and suburban landscapes, and with social inequality and exclusion. Texts by Aug\u00e9, Bailly, Bove, Bon, Clerc, Ernaux, Modinao, Perec, Rolin, Sorman and Vasset, among others. Taught in French. Class size: 18",

Students will take eleven class hours per week during the semester at Bard, plus a weekly conversation meeting with the German language tutor. The communicative approach actively involves students from day one in this class. As the course progresses, the transition is made from learning the language for everyday communication to the reading and discussion of classical and modern texts (such as Goethe, Heine, Kafka, Brecht) as well as of music and film. The concluding section of the program will be spent at Bard\u2019s sister campus in Berlin in January 2019: Students will further explore German language and culture in an intensive format (4 hours per day), which is accompanied by guided tours introducing participants to Berlin\u2019s intriguing history, architecture, and vibrant cultural life. Students interested in this class must consult with Prof. Kufner before on-line registration. (Need-based financial aid for the Berlin section of the course is available; please discuss further details with instructor.) Class size: 20",

Through a close reading of selected tales, with emphasis on language, plot, motif, and image, this course explores not only the tales\u2019 poetics and politics but also their origins in the oral tradition, in folklore and myth. The course considers major critical approaches (e.g., Freudian, Marxist, feminist) and conducts a contrastive analysis of creative adaptations (Disney, classical ballet, postmodern dance) and other fairy-tale traditions (Perrault, Straparola, Arabian Nights).

When one names a flower, what kind of knowledge is thus tacitly imparted? Which aspects of human experience do poets take recourse to the world of plants to address? How do folklore, local life, mysticism, and observation of the natural world interact in literature? Our inquiry, focused mostly on modern German-language poetry, will be nourished by close readings of poems by figures such as Celan, Goethe, Heine, and H\u00f6lderlin. We will also consult botanical guidebooks in German from the 19th and early 20th centuries. To conclude, we will ask what happens to flowers\u2014their description and their symbolic language\u2014in translation. In addition to writing critical essays to practice close reading, students will deepen their German vocabulary and linguistic abilities through regular work on creative writing projects in German.

        "description": "Less a style than a Weltanschauung of a rebellious generation, German Expressionism \u2013 flourishing roughly between 1905 and 1925 \u2013 is generally seen as an artistic reflection of a common feeling of crisis whose origins can be sought, for instance, in the loss of a cohesive world view, especially in the wake of Nietzsche's pessimistic diagnosis; the disappearance of individualism in burgeoning urban centers; the hypocrisy of Imperial Wilhelminian Germany; the soulless materialism and the (self-) alienation of increased industrialization; and the collapse of Newtonian science. Readings will include works by Frank Wedekind, Gottfried Benn, Georg Heym, Else Lasker-Sch\u00fcler, Kafka, Georg Kaiser, and Georg Trakl. Since Expressionism involved not just literature but painting, music, and film, we will also consider works by the Br\u00fccke- and Blaue Reiter-associations of painters, Alban Berg\u2019s opera Wozzeck, and films such as Der letzte Mann, M, and Die B\u00fcchse der Pandora.

The heterogeneous aspects of the Italian cultural field after WWII are considered in a wide-ranging framework, in which postwar histories are informed not simply by the external context of the Cold War but also by preceding wartime discourses. The course encompasses the ideological debate of the late 1940s, the role of aesthetics in reshaping the national self (Neorealism and its discontents), and the politics of memory enacted by literature and film (Italo Calvino, Curzio Malaparte, Carlo Levi). It also investigates the legacy of violence left by Fascism and the war, the trauma of national defeat, and Italian responsibility in WWII and the Holocaust (Primo Levi, Rosetta Loy). Finally, it surveys the persistence of gender and racial exclusions after the establishment of a new democracy. Prerequisites: Italian 202 or permission of instructor. Conducted in Italian.

Russian culture represents an inseparable part of European cultural experience. And yet, it has a distinctly original character. Initially shaped by the Orthodox Christian tradition passed on from Byzantium, it eventually came into contact and conflict with the flow of West European ideas. It absorbed and confronted, transformed and blended the major creative achievements of the Old World with the unique Russian experience. Predictably, the history of Russian music followed that path. The early development of Russian music benefited from appropriation of the Byzantine unaccompanied choral singing and at the same time suffered from the absence of instrumental music. By comparison, the Western European music combined the use of vocal and instrumental faculties and resulted in the creation of numerous forms of musical art, including the most elaborate one: opera. The flourishing of this genre in Europe consequently had a direct impact on the progress of Russian musical culture. During the nineteenth century, opera became a powerful agent in Russia\u2019s search for national identity. The list of operas includes such masterpieces as A Life for the Tsar by Glinka, Boris Godunov and Khovanshchina by Mussorgsky, The Tsar's Bride by Rimsky-Korsakov, The Queen of Spades and Eugene Onegin by Tchaikovsky, War and Peace by Prokofiev, and Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk by Shostakovich. The assigned material will also include selected literary texts as well as video and audio recordings.

However, with these technologies come a flip side to the coin, a need for caution and care in designing experiments, evaluating data, and even execution of the technology. Deep ethical concerns exist for these technologies. This course will examine these 21st century realities, with a critical eye to addressing the boundaries of ethics, and how these boundaries may be tested by biotechnological innovations. Students will be required to read current and cutting edge primary literature, as well as learn to gather evidence for both sides of these arguments, using the scientific literature as the base.

This course will require weekly meeting of assignment deadlines, and constructive peer editing in the production of many writing pieces pitched at a variety of audiences. Prerequisites: junior or senior standing, moderation into biology, or permission of the instructor. The Calderwood Seminars are intended primarily for junior and senior majors in the field (or in some cases affiliated fields--check with the faculty member if you are unsure). They are designed to help students think about how to translate their discipline (e.g. art history, biology, literature) to non-specialists through different forms of public writing. Depending on the major, public writing might include policy papers, book reviews, blog posts, exhibition catalog entries, grant reports, or editorials. Students will be expected to write or edit one short piece of writing per week. ",

In this 4-credit course, we will rely on student-led discussions of the primary literature to explore definitions and metrics of diversity, focusing on leading theories that guide our current understanding for the mechanisms that maintain diversity. We will also explore whether biodiversity is beneficial to society; for example, by characterizing the relationship of biodiversity to ecosystem services and poverty alleviation. A significant portion of the course will be devoted to learning the computational tools for quantifying and comparing diversity across systems and spatial scales. Students will apply the concepts and analytical skills learned in the first part of the semester to a class-wide project. Writing assignments include a literature review, a project pospectus, and a piece that distills scientific information into a format for the general public. Class size: 12",

As our programs scale up from a single author, user, and computer to programs designed, written, maintained, and used by multiple people that run on many computers (sometimes at the same time), considerations beyond algorithms alone are magnified. Design principles and engineering practices help us cope with this complexity: version control for multiple authors, input validation for multiple (adversarial) users, build automation tools for multiple platforms, process and thread models for parallelism. From how numbers are represented in hardware to how instruction-level parallelism and speculation can lead to bugs: the design, implementation, evaluation, safety and security of computing systems will be stressed. Students will explore computers from the ground up, using a variety of programming languages (including assembly) and tools like the command line, debuggers, and version control.

We will start with a survey of the most compelling lines of evidence for climate change, how they are obtained/derived and some of their limitations. We will then discuss in some depth idealized one-dimensional planetary radiative and thermal balance, first in the absence of an atmosphere, and then in the presence of a radiatively active one, with variable number of layers. In this context, it will become interesting to explore atmospheric opacity with respect to various radiative types, and what natural and anthropogenic effects affect this opacity. A related topic will be natural feedbacks, such as water vapor and could feedbacks. We will next place current (modern) observations of climate change in the broader context of past climates, emphasizing the last couple millennia, hundreds of millennia, and finally the ten million-year scale geological record. We will conclude the course with some discussion about the objective of a successful policy mitigation efforts, and their implementation obstacles. While not technical per se, participation in this course does require the ability to solve a couple of linear algebraic equations (like solving x + 4 = 2y and 2x - 3y = 6 for x and y) and to perform some very basic manipulation of data and plot the results (using, e.g., Microsoft's Excel).

Linear regression is an important statistical tool in psychological research as it allows for the estimation of the relationship between two or more continuous variables and the translation of this relationship into prediction. This seminar will serve as an introduction into the development, theory, and use of simple and multiple linear regression in the context of psychological research. Topics will include data visualization, hypothesis testing, model selection, parameter estimation, and estimation of model fit. Students will read and evaluate empirical articles that implement regression analyses across a range of psychological topics including applied cognitive psychology, clinical psychology, and behavioral economics. Students will get hands-on experience conducting their own regression analyses on existing datasets using the R statistical program. The course will culminate in a data collection project where students will apply regression techniques to answer a psychological question of their choosing. This course is primarily intended for moderated psychology majors and moderated MBB students; non-psychology students are also welcome and may enroll with permission from the instructor.

This course will trace the history of the 'culture concept' from the nineteenth century to the present. In doing so, it will explore anthropological approaches to 'non-modern' societies, group and personal symbols, and systems of exchange. It will examine how anthropology came to focus on questions of identity, race, gender, sexuality, nationalism, colonial and post-colonial conditions. Our ethnographic gaze will be turned inward as well as outward. We will therefore consider the reasons behind, and ramifications of, anthropology's self-reflexive turn in and around the 1980s. We will consider debates about anthropologists' engagement in activism, policy and government. We will then examine the more recent anthropological fascination with the non-human (e.g. other animals, technology, the built environment, 'nature'), looking at how notions of agency, materiality, and anthropology's own methodological foundations have been transformed as a result.

We ask how artifacts of mundane daily life and ritual materials were left in juxtaposition. At the Forest site, toward the Hudson River along an old carriage path behind Admissions, chipped stone objects afford the most conspicuous evidence of activity 5,000 years ago. Our focus, however, will be on the distribution of fragmentary ceramic vessels and whether they were made from clay found beneath a nearby waterfall. From the soil of fire pits on the adjacent promontory may emerge vestiges of plants and animals with which people interacted. Basic excavation techniques combine with microscopy and cartographic analyses to situate our discoveries in the living space. Our interpretive perspectives range in scale from miniscule wear patterns to the central Hudson Valley and beyond, to the ancient coastal Northeast. We will perform replicative experiments to make and use stone tools. Weekly writings on various studies will receive discussion in seminar. Enroll by interview with professor. Another way to prepare for this course is the Field School this summer that likely will encounter ancient artifacts through similar techniques of excavation and contextualization; for info, go to http://www.bard.edu/archaeology.

Dinosaurs appear everywhere\u2014as plush toys and chicken nuggets, as corporate mascots and public monuments, and as metaphorical critiques of nuclear weapons. In this course, we will explore the figure of the modern dinosaur both as object of scientific inquiry and as popular culture icon. We will focus on competitive exploration for dinosaur fossils at the turn of the 20th century; rivalries between paleontologists such as Edward Drinker Cope and Othniel Charles Marsh; and the rise of dinosaur philanthropy in natural history museums. We will also consider how new paleontological discoveries provoked parallel shifts in meaning and representation. How are dinosaurs articulated and brought back to life from a distant geologic past? How are they employed as metaphors for dominance, size, dim-wittedness, and obsolescence? What role do they play in the making of power and nationhood? Through the close examination of scientific and cultural histories, museums, and popular media, this course will address our fascination with dinosaurs, and how the reemergence of these prehistoric creatures helped shape our modern world.

This course will consider travel as a cultural practice and the link between travel writing and ethnography. We will first discuss several genres of travel writing (postcards, letters, journals, guide-books, ethnography) and discuss how these texts reflect as well as shape the experience of travel. We will then ask how personal, group and national identities have been constructed through the practice of travel by looking at travelers\u2019 writings from the 19th century, noting their connections to ethnographic studies written at the same time. How is \u2018home\u2019 configured in relation to foreign places in these texts? Using Jamaica Kincaid\u2019s A Small World, we will also examine some of the ethical dilemmas that tourism in particular poses: what impact does the traveler have on the communities they visit? We will then discuss travel as a rite of passage that depends on a person\u2019s absence from their home environment and provides a space that ostensibly is transformative, as in ritual pilgrimages, the Victorian Grand Tour, anthropological fieldwork or the post-college backpacking trip. Finally, we will consider the writings from exile or diaspora communities that challenge the master narrative of European travel from the \u2018center\u2019 to the \u2018periphery\u2019. The course will be based on a broad range of sources, including fiction about travel, ethnography, travelogues, letters, as well as anthropological theories about ethnography and travel writing. ",

Growth is a master concept stretching across the social sciences, and in this class, we explore the growth concept by using ethnography. We strive to understand how growth becomes real inside people\u2019s everyday activities. The class considers mining projects in Indonesia, anti-growth politics in France, the GDP of ancient Rome, and British merchant-ambassadors to China. This ethnographic evidence enters into dialogue with broader theory and policy frameworks. We engage with ecological approaches, feminist critiques, the happiness paradox, de-growth, and the struggle to reform GDP.

In the wake of such intense turmoil, nations struggled to reinvent themselves at the moment of Independence, scripting new national mythologies and appeals for unity. This course explores these contests over nationhood in the post-apartheid era, focusing primarily on the experiences of Zimbabwe and South Africa. Some of the main themes we will address include the politics of commemoration and the symbolic capital of liberation war veterans, the charismatic authority of individuals such as Nelson Mandela and Robert Mugabe, sexual violence and the trial of Jacob Zuma, the role of sport in reimagining national identity, and the paradox of white African belonging. We will examine memories of ethnic genocide in Matabeleland documented by the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace, and track new anxieties in the media precipitated by the influx of immigrants into South Africa. In the final section of the course, we will turn to recent alliances between Africa and China, and possibilities for the emergence of an alternate global order. Class size: 22",

Photographs of two-headed Iraqi babies circulate with captions about their mothers\u2019 exposure to unidentified toxic chemicals following the U.S. led invasion of Iraq. Widespread calls to close Indian Point Nuclear facility, 1.5 hours south of Bard, by 2021, remind us that we live exposed to nuclear leakage, usually without knowing it. These moments raise questions about the production of expert knowledge and the forms of evidence that count in claims-making about exposure to toxic materials. Toxicity and contamination are generally thought of as corrosive, damaging and destructive of human health and natural environments. But they are also generative. Emphasizing the exposures of populations living with war and occupation in the Middle East, this seminar investigates what toxicity and contamination make possible\u2014and thinkable\u2014 by exploring controversies around exposure to toxicity and contamination in the period between Hiroshima and Flint.

Interview-based research also forms a basis for the understanding of culture, for the construction of complex narratives, and for specialist forms such as life histories, testimonies and confessions. This class will combine critical analysis of interview-based writing\u2014and audio and video recording\u2014with the development of technical interviewing skills. Classwork will include field exercises in recording, transcription and editing, and the production of long-form, focused interviews to publishable standards. It will consider ethical and theoretical issues, the transition from speech to writing, and the enduring authority of the human voice. Class size:\n15",

The macroeconomics component studies the aggregate behavior of modern economies - the factors leading to economic growth, explanations of booms and recessions, unemployment, interest rates, inflation, and budget deficits or surpluses \u2013 and the government\u2019s ability (or inability) to use monetary and fiscal policies to achieve economic goals such as full employment and price stability.

In order to meet the last objective, we will devote most of the weekly \"lab\" sessions toward problem solving. During the lab sessions, students are expected to take turns explaining how to solve a particular problem to the rest of the class.

We read the Physiocrats, who gave us \"laissez faire\" and who advised France\u2019s landowning aristocracy that everyone would thrive if, paradoxically, the monarchy eliminated all taxes except a \"unique\" tax on land rent. We study classical political economy, shaped by great philosophers from Hume to Mill\u2014including Adam Smith, whose\nTheory of Moral Sentiments (1759) predated by seventeen years The Wealth of Nations and its much-hyped \"invisible hand\" of the market. We observe how the use of calculus transformed the methods, the models, and even the questions of economic theory. We trace the genesis of neoclassical economics, which dominates the discipline today. We explore heterodox thought from the socialist debate to the Austrian school, whose distinctive theories of production, capital, and time later morphed into the \"free market\" position associated with conservative political ideology. We ask: What problems did economic philosophers seek to resolve? How did economics emerge as a distinct discipline to become professionalized in the universities? How did theory respond to changing economic and political environments? Which ideas remain at the core of economic thought, and which have been jettisoned? Have any insights been forgotten?",

Many young people today fear that Social Security will go bankrupt long before they will reach retirement age. Costs of medical care continue to grow faster than GDP. Many private pensions are underfunded, and employers are switching from defined benefit plans to risky defined contribution plans. Will we be able to take care of growing numbers of seniors? If Social Security fails, will you have to support your own parents? Will you be able to accumulate enough retirement savings to see you through your \"golden years\"? How has \"Obamacare\" ameliorated gaps in our healthcare system? Does the proposal pushed by Bernie Sanders to extend Medicare-like coverage to all Americans make sense?

While such a comparison might seem straightforward, it is actually hard because other factors -- how sample data are collected, which individuals choose to participate in the labor market, variations in their education and family background etc. -- are likely to affect the sample means. Using sophisticated methods, econometrics allows analysts to cleverly isolate the effect of the wage gap due to gender alone. It is this last aspect that makes econometrics both challenging and exciting, and this course promises to take you on an exciting sleuthing journey at the end of which you could expect to develop the skills of a thoughtful data detective.

The stories on the news are almost always connected with people, whether we observe them shouting bids in a trading floor or talking on two phones simultaneously. Financial markets are dominated by people behaving in many different ways. Yet traditional finance theories concentrate on efficient markets, predictable prices that are determined by the concepts of present value, rates of return and analysis and pricing of computable risks. Human behavior has neither a place in the theory nor a need to be studied. This prevailing view has recently been challenged by the new paradigm of behavioral finance that considers the many anomalies of \"rational\" behavior and \"efficiency\" of markets. The new paradigm concerns itself with economic decision-making and investor psychology, and specifically with questions relating to how and why people exhibit a mixture of rational and irrational behavior. The seminar will examine the influence of economic psychology in the decision-making process of various agents as well as in the market's dynamics. Several guest lecturers will also offer their informed views in the development of ontemporary finance. Class size: 15",

Each week will also consider the implications of colonial history on current American flashpoints of migration, culture, gender equity, and Indigenous rights. Class size: 22",

        "description": "Cross-listed: History, Religion This interdisciplinary course will introduce students to major themes in the field of Jewish Studies. The primary focus will be on the history of the Jewish people and on Judaism as a religion, but we will also examine topics in Jewish literature, society, and politics. The course will treat selected themes from the Biblical period to the present, but with a greater emphasis on the medieval and especially the modern period. Among the issues to be explored: What role has the Land of Israel played in Jewish life, and how have Jews responded to their nearly 2,000-year experience of exile and Diaspora? How have they negotiated both the \"push\" of antisemitism and the \"pull\" of assimilation to maintain distinct forms of community and identity? What role have various types of texts played in Jewish culture, and what is their relationship to lived Jewish experience? Finally, what are the implications of such momentous recent events as the Holocaust, the establishment of the State of Israel, and the rise of the American Jewish community?",

        "description": "Cross-listed: Africana Studies; American Studies (2 credits) The nation's colleges and universities have clearly served as stepping stones, remediating against racial inequalities by providing pathways toward upward mobility for blacks and other minorities. At the same time, historian Craig Wilder's EBONY AND IVY (2013), linking elite American institutions to slavery, Brown University's disclosures of the fortune made in the trans-Atlantic slave trade by its founders, and the recent acknowledgement by Georgetown University of its sale of slaves to pay off antebellum debts are just a few examples of the ways in which the role played by institutions of higher learning in reproducing racial and other social hierarchies in the United States has been proven. How have these contradictory dynamics manifested themselves at Bard College? In this Engaged Liberal Arts and Sciences (ELAS) course, we will explore this question by reviewing the College's evolving admissions policies toward historically underrepresented students and learning the experiences of alumni of color at the College. Social profile, oral history, and mapping methodologies have been utilized in past versions of this course. This time, these will be expanded to include investigations into the business relations of key College founders. Class size: 22",

How, then, did it become an emerging world power by the early 20th century? Why did Japan\u2019s transformations during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries lead to the total war of the 1930s and 1940s? And why did the horrible destruction experienced after World War II ultimately result in rapid economic growth and renewed global importance for Japan after the 1950s? These questions provide the framework for our study of modern Japanese history. Throughout the course we will focus special attention on Japan\u2019s distinctive urban culture, the changing role of women in Japanese society, the re-invention of Japan\u2019s imperial institution, the domestic and international effects of Japanese imperialism, and the question of the United States\u2019 role in Japan\u2019s post-war reconstruction. Readings of drama, fiction, satire, and memoir will contribute to our exploration of these and other topics. No prior study of Japan is necessary; first-year students are welcome. Class size: 22",

        "description": "Cross-listed: Middle Eastern Studies In the aftermath of World War I, the Ottoman Empire disappeared from the world scene. In its place arose numerous states, which today make up the Middle East and significant parts of Eastern Europe. In all of these \"post-Ottoman\" states, the memory of the Ottoman Empire is well and alive. For example, it is in relation to the Ottoman legacy that modern Middle Eastern and East European national identities were constructed and claims to national borders settled (or not). This course is a general historical survey of Ottoman history from the founding of the empire around 1300 until its collapse in the aftermath of World War I. The course covers major topics in Ottoman history, including the empire\u2019s origins, its Islamic and European identities, everyday life under the Ottomans, inter-communal relations, the challenge of separatist movements (Balkan, Greek, Arab) and the emergence of modern Turkish nationalism.

        "description": "Cross-listed: German Studies, Human Rights The development of the German nation-state has been at the center of nearly every dystopian reality and utopian aspiration of modern continental Europe. This course will examine the history of the German-speaking lands from Napoleon's dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806 through the development of the German state in 1871, the cataclysmic initiation by this state of the two twentieth-century World Wars, and the creation of the new political entity of the European Union. Attention will placed throughout on the dialog of Germany and Europe in relation to regional structural issues, particularly state form and Realpolitik, capitalism and communism, the 'second-industrial revolution' and institutional development, and state control or surveillance and systems of rights. Using an array of primary documents, we will examine Germany's pivotal place in the ideological divisions, political catastrophes, and -- more optimistically -- theoretical, political, and scientific innovations of modern Europe. As a guiding theme, we will use the paradox that even as Germany is chronologically perhaps the most 'modern' of European states, its definition - and with it the identity of its citizens - has been haunted since inception by its heterogeneous past. Topics of particular importance will include: the multiple 'unifications' of Germany (as a culture, a state, a racist 'greater' Germany, a reunified power within the European Union), the role of 'German' and 'European' identity in colonial expansion and Nazi propaganda, 'scientific' racism and the Holocaust, the development of the DDR and BRD, the consolidation of the European Union since 1951, and the student protests of 1968.

We will begin with an overview of the history of the Holocaust and the main questions that scholars have asked about this and other instances of genocide. We will then examine various definitions of resistance and collaboration, including patterns of reaction variously termed passive, armed, cultural, and spiritual resistance. We will also look at the range of behaviors among bystander groups ranging from collaboration and inaction to rescue. Our focus will be the Jewish communities of Poland, the largest to fall under Nazi rule. By reading a number of scholars with widely varying views, including Hannah Arendt, Yehuda Bauer, and Isaiah Trunk, we will grapple with the issues raised on several levels: Theoretically, what are the most useful definitions of these terms? Empirically, how can we understand the extent of resistance and collaboration that took place historically? Ethically, how can we access behavior as \"reasonable\" or morally justified in such extreme circumstances? ",

This course uses the technological history of the radio in Africa to explore histories of political activism, leisure, cultural production and entertainment across Sub-Saharan Africa from colonial to present times. From a topical perspective, the course will cover the development of radio stations and distribution markets, the politics of programming and censorship, international development agencies\u2019 push for community radio, and radio dramas. Using theoretical texts on sound, affect and oral tradition, students will identify different cultures of listening with the aim of unpacking what it means to use words and music in order to \"broadcast\" history.

In addition to being an oceanic divide, the Indian Ocean is a historiographical tradition through which to think about Africa\u2019s historical past in ways not permitted by the Black Atlantic tradition. This course seeks to engage the Indian Ocean as both an object of study and a theoretical lens onto Africa\u2019s history. In turn, it will consider the ways that populations in Africa and Asia even before European colonization engaged with the Ocean in their daily lives as well as how such activities like fishing, sailing and farming reshaped geographies of colonization and resistance in East and Central Africa. Students will use architectural plans and traveler accounts to reconstruct the historical origins of slave and trading towns on the Swahili Coast. Participants will also consider how this early history set the backdrop against which not only nationalist movements fought for Southern Africa\u2019s independence but the Cold War played out in Africa. This colonial and nationalist context offers an analytical space to revisit more recent engagements with the Indian Ocean, particularly China\u2019s and Brazil\u2019s renewed interest with the region, the mineral wars of the Great Lakes, and the identity politics at play around displaced migrant communities. This course seeks to use the history of the Indian Ocean as it relates to Africa in order to prompt a rethinking of the geographical and theoretical axes along which we engage with African histories of colonialism, nationalism, and decolonization.

Separation of Families. Immigrant Rights.\nSanctuary. Refugee Resettlement. These words - usually confined to policy, enforcement, and activism related to migrants and refugees - have recently exploded into the public view and entered into constant use. The current political administration made migratory and refugee enforcement, and of migration more generally, a centerpiece of its electoral campaign and the subject of its first executive orders, generating broad public controversy. Most migration to the US is from Latin America, by far the largest single migrant population is from Mexico, and the rise of Central American migration has proved enduring. Focusing on south-north migration from these Latin American regions, this class argues that it is impossible to understand the current political situation in the US without studying the relatively lesser-known history of migrant and refugee human rights over the last three decades, including massive protests, movements for sanctuary, and attempts at reform and enforcement. The class takes into account shifting global demographics, changing reasons for migration, rapid legal and political changes, complex enforcement policies and practices, and powerful community movements for reform, which are often forgotten with the opening and closing of a given news cycle. The class also argues that migrant and refugee voices matter and are critical to understanding migration as an historical and current problem. The course includes migrant, refugee, and activist narratives, and an array of historical, legal, political, and other primary sources. Its goal is to create a more complete historical understanding of Latin American-origin migration in the contemporary US context. Class size: 22",

        "department": "history",
        "description": "Cross-listed: Historical Studies; Literature At the end of the third century AD, the Roman Empire stretched from Spain to Asia Minor. It was so vast that its administration was divided into eastern and western zones. Two hundred years later, the Empire lost control of most of its western provinces. The events associated with these losses constitute the \"Fall of the Roman Empire.\" This course takes an interdisciplinary perspective (incorporating archaeological, scientific, and literary evidence) to explore the causes behind the collapse of the imperial structure, and to assess the afterlife of Roman culture in the \"Barbarian\" West through the seventh century. It will track not only how institutions of government and religion changed, but also how human imaginations, identities, values, and cultural commitments evolved in response to crisis and in the aftermath of empire. Readings (in English translation) will introduce students to historians (Gregory of Tours), poet-philosophers (Boethius), theologians (Augustine), and letter writers (Sidonius Apollinaris) who reacted with astonishing self-awareness and creativity to their changing Roman worlds. By the end of the course, students will be equipped to produce historically sensitive close readings of late ancient texts, and to parse them with an eye toward categories of culture and identity. They can also expect to develop their own answers to one of ancient history\u2019s most vexing questions: did the fall of the Roman Empire signal \"the triumph of barbarism\" and the \"end of civilization,\" or did continuity prevail? No previous knowledge of Rome is assumed. Class size: 22",

        "description": "Cross-listed: Africana Studies; American Studies; Human Rights (core course); Latin American Studies Scholars have argued that there is an intimate relationship between the contemporary wealth of the developed world and the money generated through four hundred years of chattel slavery in the Americas and the transatlantic slave trade. Is there something essential that links capitalism, even liberal democratic capitalism, to slavery? How have struggles against slavery and for freedom and rights, dealt with this connection? This course will investigate the development of this linkage, studying areas like the gender dynamics of early modern Atlantic slavery, the correlation between coercive political and economic authority, and the financial implications of abolition and emancipation. We will focus on North America and the Caribbean from the early 17th century articulation of slavery through the staggered emancipations of the 19th century. The campaign against the slave trade has been called the first international human rights movement \u2013 today does human rights discourse simply provide a human face for globalized capitalism, or offer an alternative vision to it? Questions of contemporary reparations, rising colonialism and markets of the nineteenth century, and the 'duty' of the Americas to Africa will also be considered. Readings will include foundational texts on capitalism and a variety of historical approaches to the problem of capitalism within slavery, from economic, cultural, and intellectual perspectives. There are no prerequisites, although HIST 130, 2133, or 263 all serve as introductory backgrounds. Class size: 22",

In all these forms and many others, political ritual has been central to nation-building, colonialism, and political movements over the last three centuries. This course uses a global, comparative perspective and readings from a range of academic disciplines to analyze the modern history of political ritual. We will explore the emergence of new forms of political ritual with the rise of the nation-state in the nineteenth century and track global transformations in the performance of politics as colonialism spread the symbols and pageantry of the nation-state. Central topics will include state ritual and the performance of power, the relationship between ritual and citizenship in the modern nation-state, the ritualization of politics in social and political movements, and the power of mediated mass spectacle in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Seminar meetings will focus on discussion of secondary and primary materials that allow us to analyze the intersection of ritual and politics in a variety of contexts. These will range from early-modern Europe, pre-colonial Bali, and late-imperial China to revolutionary France, 19th-century America, colonial India, post-colonial Africa, several fascist and socialist states, Europe in 1968, the modern Middle East, and the contemporary global marketplace. In addition to common readings and seminar participation, students will do a final project exploring one aspect or instance of political ritual. Moderated history students can use this course for a major conference; Experimental Humanities students are encouraged to do a multi-media project. Class size: 15",

Our primary goal will be to think about historical narratives of the (post-) colonial worlds as constructed artifacts and as products of certain intellectual environments. For each meeting, we will explore an influential school of historical writing, such as the French Annales or Italian Microhistory. Alongside these explorations, we will study examples of the scholarship on (post-) colonial history that engage with these historiographical traditions. Our discussions will revolve around the possibilities and limits of writing history in light of the existent historical sources, academic and disciplinary norms, other disciplinary influences (especially from literature and anthropology), as well as present political considerations.

This class is a course in the reading of theory and the history of theory in Africa, and it will shift away from the temporal understanding of the post-colonial concept in order to conceptualize the postcolonial (without a hyphen) as a theoretical shift and site of engagement over the discourses of colonialism, nationalism, race, and globalization. Drawing from scholars and political theorists from the African continent as well as Subaltern Studies, students will cover the topics of historiography, the relationship of power to knowledge production, and critiques of colonialism, nationalism, and apartheid.

        "department": "history",
        "description": "This seminar examines changes and trends in the research and writing of history as practiced by professional historians. After brief consideration of the origins of history as a formal academic discipline in the 19th Century, and of the transition from political to social history in the mid-twentieth century, we also consider the shift from social history to the multiplicity of approaches that came out of the \"theory explosion\" between the 1960s and early 2000s. This course draws from the fields of modern European, African, and World History. Course readings shall consist mostly (but not entirely) of historical writing about the Great War from a variety of historiographical points of view. Readings also include a wide range of primary materials. Conventional teaching on WWI tends to follow the diplomatic history approach, and to emphasize the war on the western front. To enlarge this view, we will read not only from the classic \"causes of WWI\" literature, but also from gender, cultural, and post\u00ad colonial treatments of the war, and read about the impact of the war on the eastern front, on China, in Africa. Working with this diversity of texts gives us the opportunity explicitly to discuss how different historiographical approaches change how we understand \"what happened.\" This course satisfies the historiography requirement for Historical Studies concentrators; it may also serve as a Major Conference if arranged with the instructor. This course is cross-listed with the MAT program for 4+1 students in social studies/history. Class size: 5",

This course introduces students to the practice of philosophy through investigation of its ancient origins. The course begins by looking at the emergence of philosophy as a distinct cultural practice in ancient Greece, focusing on its complex relations with neighboring practices, such as those of religion, poetry, politics and science. The centerpiece of the course is a sustained examination of the iconic yet enigmatic figure of Socrates, whose exemplary life and death made him the paradigmatic philosopher in antiquity and for centuries after. In approaching Socrates, we will consider the conflicting accounts of his character and activities given by the historian Xenophon, the comedian Aristophanes, and the philosopher-dramatist Plato. The final part of the course provides an overview of some of the main schools of philosophy to emerge following the death of Socrates, exploring their development of novel philosophical theories, practices, and forms of community.

In the domain of arguments, rhetoric and reason coexist in an eternal tension. From the standpoint of logic, an argument aims to prove that its conclusion is true. On the side of rhetoric, the person making an argument aims to persuade others to accept the conclusion. Some arguments are logically valid but fall flat; some arguments are highly convincing but logically worthless. The fault lies not in language but in our use of it. The course encourages an appreciation of the richness of meaning and also seeks to inculcate an analytical understanding of an argument\u2019s working logical parts. Since this is a Philosophy course, it has an arguable bias towards reason. Class size: 22",

Thus the two texts, so different in style, tone, and narrative arc, are not only in conversation with each other but literally open up into each other. We will pay close attention to such themes as perspectivism, literary experimentalism, philosophy (and life) as art, the diagnosis of modernity as cultural nihilism, the recovery of the body, the central role of the unconscious, and the concepts of the will to power, the revaluation of values, the overman, and the death of god.

Is the US an empire given its influence and power in the global economy? How can development be redefined to tackle the challenge of climate change? Among issues that we will look at closely is the role of organizations such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the World Trade Organization in managing the global economy and the current debates about reforming these institutions.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Global & International Studies (core course); Human Rights What does it mean to be a global citizen? This question has gained increasing salience as the world has become more globalized. With globalization new problems surface that cut across national borders and fall outside the jurisdiction of individual nation-states. In response new forms of political organization have emerged to address these problems, which challenge the state as the primary locus of political authority and ultimate source of individual rights. In particular, these individuals and groups have appealed to a kind of global citizenship from below to call for action on and demand redress for the harms created by globalization. This interdisciplinary course critically examines the conceptual and theoretical foundations of the concept of global citizenship and investigates how the idea might work in practice. We begin by considering the conceptual, philosophical and historical debates about citizenship. What does it mean to be a citizen of a particular state? What obligations and responsibilities accompany citizenship? How have understandings of citizenship changed and expanded over time? What is global citizenship and how does it differ from national citizenship? Next we evaluate these ideas about citizenship in the context of globalization and the new problems created by an increasingly interdependent world. Topics covered may include: migration and refugees; the environment and resources; (in)security and borders; health and infectious disease; and development and inequality. We conclude by assessing the role (if any) global citizenship can play in global governance and consider how the international system might be transformed to better address the challenges of globalization. This course will be taught concurrently at Bard's international partner institutions. Students will benefit from collaboration with peers at these institutions. ",

Although some democracies are among the most developed in the world, such as Chile, Uruguay and Costa Rica, the region is also home to some notorious \"illiberal\" democracies, such as Guatemala, and one of the world\u2019s few remaining Communist states, Cuba. The course is organized in three main sections. The first provides a broad historical overview of patterns of political development in Latin America from the independence period to the present. The second part highlights theoretical approaches to Latin American political development drawn from cultural analysis, Marxism, and state-centric perspectives. The third and final section examines democratic development in five Latin American countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Cuba, and Venezuela). Class size: 22",

The first part of the semester looks at the history of the idea of constitutionalism in Ancient Greece, 18th century England, France, and the United States. The remainder of the semester will be devoted to a critical examination of the contemporary workings of constitutional law, focusing primarily on decisions of the highest courts of United States, India and South Africa relating to critical human rights issues. The course confronts core questions of the role of a constitution in the state and the particular challenges of a written constitution enforced by courts. By looking at constitutional enforcement comparatively, the course offers the opportunity to test theoretical assumptions and get beyond the US-centered approach that has dominated constitutional study for a variety of reasons (not least of which, the fact that the US has the longest and best established tradition of constitutional enforcement.) In addition to theoretical and historical readings, the course will include substantial case law readings. Students will also have the opportunity in their research to explore constitutional systems beyond South Africa, India and the United States. Beyond legal cases, readings include Aristotle, Montesquieu, Bodin, Arendt, and the Federalist Papers. Class size: 40",

        "description": "Cross-listed: Environmental & Urban Studies; Global & International Studies; Human Rights The study of economic development of the \"Third World\" has gone through several intellectual phases. The first generation of scholars viewed the process somewhat optimistically as the global extension of modernity. Neo-Marxist critics tried to locate Third World underdevelopment in the history of colonialism and in the persistence of structures of dependency of Third World countries. \"Post-development\" theorists took on the idea of development itself. Globalization and the emergence of a new international division of labor, has reframed the debates. Developing countries like Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico and South Africa are now members of the G-20 group of countries, which many see as a likely successor to the G8 group of leading industrial economies. After reading representative authors of competing theoretical traditions, we will move on to concrete cases. This segment will be shaped partly by student interest.

This course offers students a survey of twentieth century French political thought from the perspective of \"the death of man.\" We will explore how thinkers, from Catholics and anticolonial nationalists to structuralists and feminists, critiqued the idea of man. We will also study how these thinkers sought to redefine some of the basic concepts of politics\u2014freedom, sovereignty, rights\u2014without the idea of man. Our goal will be to understand the myriad currents of French thought, the better to understand the evolution of European political theory in the twentieth century.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Human Rights, Philosophy In 1946, just after the defeat of the Nazis, a French schoolteacher Jean Beaufret wrote a letter to the German philosopher Martin Heidegger. Beaufret asked two questions: First, How are we in the wake of the Holocaust to restore a sense to the word \"humanism\"? And second, How are we to understand the relationship between philosophy and ethics? Heidegger\u2019s response, later published as \"The Letter on Humanism,\" is one of the great efforts to think through the ethical and philosophical significance of the human being. For Heidegger, if we are to preserve the dignity of the human, we must forgo all \u2018isms\u2019 including humanism; we must resist the urge to define a human essence and instead seek the dignity of the human outside of all doctrines and systems. In doing so, Heidegger challenges the foundations of modern humanisms including human rights and liberal social democracy. In this class we will read Heidegger\u2019s \u2018Letter on Humanism\u2019 as well as works by Jean Paul Sartre, Hannah Arendt, and Peter Sloterdijk to ask how, if at all, we can assign dignity to humanity in the 21st century.

Beginning with Sophocles\u2019 Antigone, moving through Hegel, Kant, Lacan, and Butler, we will explore how conceptions of desire shape approaches to questions of political recognition. How does the language of desire shape the way we think about forms of political recognition? Is desire productive? How does the act of desire constitute the other? We will read works by Freud, Bataille, Foucault, Brown, Deleuze, Califa, Rubin, Delaney, Bersani, and others to explore the ways we think about liberal subjectivity and the intersections of knowledge and power.

Countless acts of political violence occur at the macro, micro, and structural levels all the time, yet only some get linked together across time and understood as a \"war\". What makes a time of war different from a time of peace? How does temporality operate to allow us to see, for example, the war on terrorism as one continuous war, rather than a series of unrelated operations, battles, and assassinations? In this course we will explore the conceptions of war and time that animate international politics and inform the practice of international relations. To begin we will focus on the configurations of power that constitute the state and produce dominant assumptions about international politics. Next, we will investigate the ways that these practices reproduce the centrality of the state as the dominant actor of international politics and maintain itself as the sole authority invested in deciding when and where there is war and there is peace. The course will conclude by examining contemporary foreign policy issues with the theoretical and conceptual tools we\u2019ve developed so as to better engage some of the deeper structural issues that animate contemporary security practices by the United States as well as other groups. Throughout, the course readings will challenge received ideas of temporality and time, the state and war that are at the center of international relations scholarship and practice.

The focus of the course will be primarily on ancient Zoroastrianism, and on the classical textual tradition, especially the Avesta and Middle Persian literature. We will also examine Zoroastrianism in Colonial India, the Islamic Republic of Iran, and across the Diaspora; look at the great variety of Zoroastrian responses to modernity; and consider the appearance of Zoroastrianism in modern media, including film, works of modern philosophy (mostly famously, Nietzsche) and novels. Apart from opening a window into an influential, if little understood, religious tradition, studying Zoroastrianism will allow us to consider key issues in the study of religion, such as the dynamics of influence and the evolution of religions. NOTE: No previous knowledge of the topic is expected, even as engagement with any of the major religious traditions will be illuminated by the study of Zoroastrianism. Class size: 22",

Religious seekers pioneered the spiritual techniques that have come to be practiced in the United States, after considerable alteration, as yoga, meditation, and mindfulness. This course will examine the religious debates of the period, the social organizations of the Buddhist monastic order and the Brahmin class, the ascetic non-violence of the Jains, and the search for a righteous form of political rule. Emphasis in the course will be on engagement with primary written sources from classical India, such as the Vedic Upanishads, the earliest Buddhist sutras, the edicts of Emperor Ashoka, and Hindu epic poetry. Archeological remains will also provide primary sources, including the Ashokan pillars, Buddhist stupa sculpture, and the earliest Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain icons. Class size: 16",

Most importantly, students will come away from the course with a new understanding of how to think sociologically about the world around them, their position in society, and how their actions both affect and are affected by the social structures in which we all live.

The course will then consider the relationship between globalization and the modern city before concluding with a few examples of how citizens address the challenges in their communities. Throughout, we will explore the diverse methods that social scientists use to understand these dynamics, and students will have the opportunity to utilize some of these methods in an investigation of a local \"urban community.\" This foundational course is of interest to EUS concentrators but does not fulfill EUS program and focus area requirements.

In the first, we will learn how to formulate research questions and hypotheses, how to choose the appropriate research method for the problem, and how to maximize chances for valid and reliable findings. In the second part, we will learn how to perform simple data analysis and how to interpret and present findings in a written report. For a final paper, students use data from the U.S. General Social Survey (GSS) to study public attitudes toward issues such as abortion, immigration, inequality and welfare, affirmative action, gender roles, religion, the media, and gun laws.

Third, we analyze the social consequences of a changing natural world, focusing on the unequal distribution of the benefits and burdens of environmental change.

This will help us to see how classical sociological thinkers \u2013 especially Marx, Weber, and Durkheim \u2013 drew on legal concepts and traditions in formulating their theories of social order (and disorder). Then, shifting between historical and theoretical perspectives, we will study the myriad ways in which law is impacting, and is impacted by, the social forces of the modern world. We will focus especially on the role that law plays in making modern, industrialized capitalism possible.

Students will read cutting-edge studies of various parts of the penal system, including the prosecutors, courts, juvenile detention, prisons, and police. We will examine aspects that get little attention, such as fines, treatment programs, and the use of big data. The course digs into new research on the social and political roots of mass incarceration and the carceral state, especially their relationship to welfare policy, inequality, and racial politics. We will consider punishment in its larger context and its relationship to broader forms of social control. This includes examining the lives of formerly incarcerated people, the multiple ways that women of color are policed, and popular depictions of drug users. Through this course, students will learn how we got here and to think rigorously about what could be done about it. Prerequisite: By permission of the instructor, or successful completion of SOC 224 Punishment, Prisons, and Policing . Class size: 15",

        "department": "bgia",
        "description": "Cross-listed: Environmental & Urban Studies; Global & International Studies Non-state actors have gained increasing importance in international affairs, and the expanded role of cities is often overlooked. Particularly in the post-9/11 era, cities are directly managing a wide variety of international issues and are hubs for the international movement of people, money and ideas. New York City is the ideal case study: city police are deployed overseas to monitor terrorist networks, financial institutions manage the global flow of trillions of dollars, the UN is the headquarters of international diplomacy, the city hosts a diverse mix of NGOs and major media, and New York is the destination for immigrants arriving from all corners of the world. This course explores the theoretical debates and practical policy effects of cities as non-state actors in international affairs. How should we define non-state actors? Where do cities fit in those debates? What strategies do different non-state actors use to influence national and global policy-making, with a particular focus on cities? In addition, the course contextualizes students\u2019 internship experiences within this broader discussion to critically examine how ideas about the role of non-state actors in world politics play out in practice. We will take advantage of our New York City location with guest speakers from a wide spectrum of organizations within the field, such as the United Nations, US State Department, New York Police Department, the Federal Reserve, Human Rights Watch, New York State Homeland Security, Council on Foreign Relations, World Policy Institute, Open Society Foundation, and many others.

Yet the character and distribution of power has changed dramatically since the rise of the modern state system in the 17th century. For nearly two decades now, American primacy has defined the global power structure. This fact is an historic anomaly; at no time in history has any one state amassed the degree of military, economic, and political power the United States now enjoys. In fact, contemporary American foreign policy is premised on the assertion that the United States must sustain its primacy against any potential challengers for the indefinite future. This course explores the character of power and war in this era of American hegemony. We will examine the vigorous debates over the objectives of American power, unilateralism versus multilateralism as rival approaches to exercising power, debates over what military power can actually achieve, and the potential for a global backlash against the United States. Among other specific issues this course will address is the rise of China and India and the implications for global security and economic issues; rogue states and nuclear proliferation; the preventive war option to address shifting threats; the political and strategic future of the Middle East; terrorism as an alternative form of the power struggle and as a type of asymmetric warfare waged by nonstate actors; the continuing problem of humanitarian crises, failed states and intervention in the post-9/11 world; and the changing nature of global energy politics as an acute security issue.

We\nwill pursue relevant questions such as: what exactly are the\ncriteria for inclusion in such categories, do art markets drive\nthis labeling, how does this work function within the art world,\nare categorical borders crossed in order to fit the needs of\nexhibiting institutions, and finally how has Outsider Art impacted\nmainstream modern and contemporary art and are the dividing lines\nbetween the two still relevant? We will look at artwork produced\nwithin certain institutional settings such as mental asylums and\nprisons, as well as that produced by mediums, spiritualists and\nother \"visionaries\" working within what can be best described as a\n\"folk art\" category.

How have artists understood\ntheir work as modern? What have artists and critics meant when they\ntalked about realism and abstraction? In a period shaped by two\nworld wars, Jim Crow laws, and women's suffrage, how did artists\nrespond to social injustice and warfare? Covering a range of media\nand genres, we will explore these and other questions about art\nmaking in the context of social and political events. Topics\ninclude: \u2018modernity' and nationalism; technology and art;\nexhibitions and cultural propaganda; artistic identity and gender\nand racial roles; public art, murals, and social\nactivism.

        "description": "\nAn ex voto is a votive offering to a saint or deity. It is given as\na token of gratitude for a miracle performed and in some cases it\nis offered as a vow. The ex voto is the most basic and fundamental\nform of material exchange between humans and deities. Almost\nanything, regardless of size, weight, form, or original function,\ncan become a votive object once it is offered with intent. In its\nessence the votive offering is a material object that celebrates an\nimmaterial event, a physical object that commemorates or expects\nsupernatural activity. From archaic Greece to modernity and from\nthe Himalayan slopes to the forests of Brazil, votive offerings are\nthe most universal practice in the history of mankind. This seminar\nis set to explore the relationship between humans and deities\nacross cultures through the basic act of votive exchange.\n\nIssues relating to participation by devotees will be considered as the basis for the seminar, as\nwell as theories from fields of history of religion, art history,\nanthropology and economics. Together they will serve to examine and further our understanding of\nthe unique phenomenon of the votive giving. The seminar is given as\npart of the planning of the exhibition Agents of Faith: Votive Giving Across\nCultures, scheduled to open in the Bard Graduate Center Gallery\nin New York in September 2018 and some of the sessions in the\nseminar will be devoted to curatorial issues involved in the\nmounting of the exhibition.

        "description": "\n\nCross-listed: Art\nHistory; German\nStudies 8\ncredits According\nto the political scientist Francis Fukuyama 1989 marked the \"end of\nhistory.\" The so-called triumph of Western-style capitalism and\nliberal democracy, frequently represented by the fall of the Berlin\nWall, meant that there would be no more struggle and no more\ncontestation: a single ideology would now dominate the world. But\nis this true? Today we find ourselves in a world in urgent need of\nre-imagining the ways we wish to live together. Does the current\nhistorical moment of 2017 with its re-emergence of aggressive\nnationalism, authoritarian government, and threat to plurality\nconfront us with another turning point to possibly bookend the\nmomentum of opening, diversity, and new beginnings after 1989? This\ncourse will seek to map the connections between post-1989 practices\nand their wider historical moment up to the present. We will\ndiscuss, among others, artworks by Hans Haacke, Hito Steyerl, and\nIlya Kabakov, poetry and prose by Ingo Schulze, Terezia Mora, and\nNobel Prize winner Herta M\u00fcller as well as theoretical writings by\nBruno Latour, Jean-Luc Nancy, William Kentridge, and \u00e9douard\nGlissant. The class will scrutinize pivotal films created in\nresponse to 1989, and we will visit with contemporary artists and\nfilmmakers. In concert with our weekly class conversations, this\ncourse will foster various formats of presentations and\ncollaborative work, combining analytical and creative modes of\nengaging with the diverse materials. \n",

In the 1960s, there was a\nmarked shift in creative practices that opened up who could perform and create\nperformance. The artists who created\nthis expansion ushered in a new level of cross-disciplinary collaboration and\nparticipation, the effects of which we continue to utilize today. We'll explore these artists' trends alongside\nmodernism and postmodernism's philosophical developments, modern and postmodern\ncharacteristics of other art forms, and significant political and cultural\ndevelopments influencing the modern/postmodern distinction. Student interests will inform which artists\nand aspects of this rich moment in history we'll focus on, and classwork will\ninclude embodied explorations that enable us to experience firsthand the\npivotal shifts in creative processes and compositional values for live\nperformance. Video, class discussion,\nfocused weekly readings, and reflective analysis assignments will complement\nour practice-based learning. The course\nwill culminate in a two-part final project comprised of performance/physical\nresearch and writing. This course\nfulfills the dance history requirement for the dance major and is a worthwhile\ncourse for any student interested in performance practices that involve\nmovement and cross-disciplinary collaboration.\nClass size:\n15",

An examination of Charles Burnett's films will provide a\ntouchstone for exploring a multitude of approaches to this question, such as:\nautobiography, observations of one's social environment, and the use of a\nliterary work assource material for the development of a personal\nnarrative rather than the basis of a strict adaptation. The course will\nilluminate how everyday experiences and often overlooked interactions become\nthe material of narrative film art.Structured as a screenwriting\nworkshop, students will write a short screenplay during the course of the\nsemester that grows out of their individual experiences, observations, and/or a\nrange of influences, including literary works and historical experiences they\nfeel personally impacted by. In the following semester, they will direct\nand edit their screenplays.",

Taking\nexamples from China, Cuba, Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, this course surveys the cultural policies\nof socialist states and their effects on the lives, listening habits, and\ncreative output of musicians and music consumers. From the politics of Azeri\nopera, to the subversive sounds of Siberian punk, to the performance of\nmasculinity in Chinese and Cuban pop music, we will investigate how political\nideologies generated state support for certain kinds of music while suppressing\nother forms of unofficial, underground and protest music. Students will develop\nan understanding of how socialist cultural policy models in diverse regions of\nthe world have understood the uses and the threats posed by musical culture in\ndaily and symbolic life. Furthermore, we will evaluate what happens when the\nideological imperatives of a regime transform, fade away, or are suddenly\nreplaced with a new political ideology. Readings\ninclude historical, anthropological, and musicological texts that examine the\nrelationship of musical sound to publics, counterpublics and states. Students\nwill produce written works responding to class readings and themes, and develop\nfinal projects according to their own research interests. Students do not need\nto read musical notation to take this class. This course fulfills requirements\nfor the Global and International Studies program and counts towards the\nmoderation requirements in ethnomusicology.\nClass size:\n22",

During the first hour of the class all students will receive\nan original ATM (Awareness through\nMovement) lesson, especially chosen for its pertinence to singing, as designed by Moshe Feldenkrais. An ATM consists of guiding students verbally\nthrough a carefully designed sequence of gentle movements in such a way that\nthe student remains mindful and keeps an inward awareness. By sequencing\nmovements in small, easily accessible increments and working with deliberate\nconstraints, unnecessary tensions can be released to form a new pattern of\nmovement with increased refinement and complexity. During the second half of\nthe class we will be working individually on repertoire, applying the\nprinciples of the Method. Requirement:\nability to perform a song or aria -\nauditions required.

Coursework will\ninclude on-line sketchbooks, site-specific installation, digital collage, gifs,\nlarge-scale printing, laser cutting and bookmaking. These projects will emerge\nout of research and a series of exercises that will build image-making skills\nand establish a digital workflow.Class size:14",

Against the moralizing rhetoric of a\npopular culture and in a world inundated with images of sex and violence, this\ncourse will explore different approaches artists and theorists have taken to\nthe continuum of pleasure and pain as a political practice in theater and\nperformance since the 1960s.  At the same time, we will question the ways\nin which sex and violence have often be used to subjugate the body, defining\nthe limits of what a body can be or do. Our course will begin with a\nbroad historical overview of the use of \"pleasure\" and \"pain\" in the context of\npost-War art. Each class will be\norganized around a different site of study  often foregrounding controversial\nexamples  that will further enrich our understanding of what it means to\ndeploy sex or violence in the context of performance.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Africana Studies; American Studies; Gender and\nSexuality Studies African American Spirituals\nand Blues music share fundamental musical structures, however they offer very\ndifferent narratives. Spirituals detail a transitory existence marked by\nsuffering that culminates in a celebratory ascendance into heaven. While\nthe blues often feature stories of anger, hurt and earthly survival is the only\ncause for celebration. In this course we will explore the critical\ninfluence these musical forms had on African American writers of the twentieth\ncentury. Writers such as James Baldwin, Toni Morrison and Ralph Ellison used\nthese musical traditions to shape their narratives and to interrogate\nexperience. James Cone maintains that both blues and spirituals \"preserve\nblack humanity through ritual and drama\" and the same could be said of the Post-Reconstruction\nAfricanAmerican novel.Among the novels we will read are: Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man; Zora\nNeal Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God; Black Boy by Richard\nWright and Devil in a Blue Dress by Walter Mosely. Bessie Smith, Robert Johnson and Willie Dixon\nare among the musicians included in our inquiry. Class\nsize: 22",

Jean-Paul Sartre maintained that \"American\ncharacter swaggered with confidence and na\u00efve optimism,\" Simone de Beauvoir\nsaid Americans had no \"feeling for sin and remorse,\" and Albert Camus\ncomplained that they \"lacked a sense of anguish about the problems of\nexistence.\" This course will challenge these assertions on a number of levels.\nFirst, we will unearth a rich existentialist current in American writing from\nEmily Dickinson to Richard Wright, Carson McCullers, and Walker Percy, and\nexplore the ways in which these writers imagine the \"problems of existence\"\ndifferently from their European counterparts. Second, we'll explore the comic\nelement that so many American writers add to the existentialist mood of \"anguish.\"\nFinally, we will strive to assess the existentialist attitude itself by asking\nquestions such as: What is the relation between personal torment and the\nbroader social or political conditions from which it arises? What are the\nconnections between this literature and the philosophical tradition that\nincludes Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Heidegger and Sartre? How do these writers\nposition themselves in relation to psychoanalysis and its account of the inner\nlife? Writers considered in this course will likely include Emily Dickinson,\nNathanael West, Richard Wright, Flannery O'Connor, Carson McCullers, Saul\nBellow, Ralph Ellison, Walker Percy, Kurt Vonnegut, Zora Neale Hurston, D.T.\nSuzuki, William Barrett, and we will also read selections from key philosophical\ntexts.

        "description": "Cross-listed:\nMedieval Studies\nAlmost\nimmediately after his death in 1400, Geoffrey Chaucer was dubbed \"the father of\nEnglish literature\" by a fellow poet and admirer. But \"poet,\" let alone \"father of English\nliterature,\" was not Chaucer's day job.\nHe was a government bureaucrat and an erstwhile envoy to England's\nking. How did Chaucer become so central\nto English literature? How do we come by\nour own Chaucerian inheritance, and how has it influenced our concepts of the\nauthor and the literary? In this course, we will pursue answers to these\nquestions, among others, by examining Chaucer's reputation from its earliest\nand highly self-conscious beginnings in his own work to its development in the\nhands of the late medieval Chaucerians: acolytes who\nstoked the flames of remembrance after Chaucer's death. We will begin by considering Chaucer's\npreoccupation (obsession?) with his classical predecessors and the relationship\nbetween rumor and reputation as we read his major shorter works, which include Anelida and Arcite, The Book of the Duchess, Troilus and Criseyde, and The House of Fame. We will then turn to Chaucer's final work and\nso-called masterpiece, The Canterbury\nTales, and some of the late medieval writers who claimed his influence and\nlegacy, including Thomas Hoccleve and John Lydgate. Note: Students do not need prior experience\nstudying Chaucer to enroll in this course; however, students who have\npreviously taken Lit. 2401 (The\nCanterbury Tales) are welcome in this course and upon its completion will\nhave read all of Chaucer's major works.

How and when\ndoes this process occur and under what (or whose) auspices? In the case of early English texts, did their\ncontemporary readers hold them in the high regard we do?

We will\ndevote extensive time to each of these texts as close and critical readers of\nliterature, but we will also examine them within their original historical,\ncultural, and manuscript contexts, and trace their movements from their\noriginal composition through time to determine how, when, and why they became\nfor us essential touchstones of the past and signifiers of good taste and\nmodern high culture. To get a sense of\nthe rich textual field from which our canonical texts have been plucked, we\nwill also read a variety of texts from Anglo-Saxon and medieval England that\nwere clearly popular in their own time, but have since fallen out of fashion\nand into obscurity: why are these alternative texts not part of our canon?

Over the course of the semester we\nwill read works that reflect a range of aesthetic approaches in order to\nbroaden our exposure to literature and enrich our palettes as emerging\npractitioners. Readings will include stories from authors such as Angela\nCarter, John Cheever, and Italo Calvino, as well as\nnarratives from contemporary and classical authors in translation. Through our\nown creative work, and the close, critical reading of our stories, we will try\nto become better artisans of language and narrative. Class size: 14",

        "description": "Nietzsche,\nperhaps anticipating Twitter or SnapChat, thought it\npossible to say in ten sentences what many say in a whole book. A master of the\naphorism, he believed condensation could penetrate rather than just abbreviate.\nIn this course we will take up the challenge, and practice compression by\nwriting prose that begins and ends on a single page. As poets have always\nknown, brevity is a catalyst to invention. We will focus on the sentence,\nrather than the line, to investigate exactly how the syntax of narrative and\ndescription conveys the movement of thought. Among the short forms we will\nexamine are early and post- modern prose sequences, micro-fictions, guide book\nentries, capsule reviews, the pr\u00e9cis, the Haibun, the\nparable, and notebook and journal entries. Among the writers included will be:\nJohn Ashbery, Samuel Becket, Thomas Bernhard, Lydia\nDavis, Russell Edson, Max Jacob, Franz Kafka, Daniil Kharms,\nTan Lin, Harry Mathews, Harryett Mullen, Leslie Scalapino, the sinologist\nEdward Schafer, scent expert Luca Turin, Paul Valery, and Joe Wenderoth. Admission by portfolio only. Though priority will be given to students intending eventually to\nwrite a senior project in poetry, all are welcome to submit for admission.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Environmental & Urban Studies; Experimental Humanities;\nHuman Rights Philosopher Thomas\nNagel asked, \"What is it like to be a bat?\" Ultimately, he determined the\nquestion unanswerable: A bat's experience of the world is so alien to our own\nthat it remains inaccessible to human cognitive empathy. That's arguable. But it is true at least that a bat's\nexperienceor that of any other nonhuman consciousnessis not inaccessible to\nhuman imagination. In this course we\nwill read and discuss a wide variety of texts, approaching the subject of\nnonhuman consciousness through literature, philosophy, and science. We will read works that attempt to understand\nthe experiences of apes, panthers, rats, ticks, elephants, octopuses, lobsters,\ncows, bats, monsters, puppets, computers, and eventually, zombies. Course\nreading may include Descartes, Kafka, Rilke, Jakob\nvon Uexk\u00fcll, Patricia Highsmith, John Gardner's Grendel, J.A. Baker's The Peregrine, Eduardo Kohn's How Forests Think, David Foster\nWallace, Temple Grandin, Frans de Waal, Jane Goodall,\nThomas Nagel, John Searle, Susan Datich, E. O.\nWilson, Giorgio Agamben, and Bennett Sims's A Questionable Shape, among others, in\naddition to a viewing of 2001: A Space\nOdyssey, Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later,\nand possibly other films. This is also a craft class, as each student will\nproduce a substantial project over the semester. The assignments will be open-ended, open to\nboth creative and analytical works; a major component of the class will be\nincorporating these ideas into our own writing. This course is part of the Thinking Animals Initiative, an\ninterdivisional collaboration among students and faculty to further the\nunderstanding of animals and human-animal relationships.

The personal essay\nis an informal essay that begins in the details of everyday life and expands to\na larger idea. Emphasis is placed on reading closely to discover the craft of\nthe work: how scenes and characters are developed, how dialogue can be used,\nhow the form can fracture from linear narrative to the collage. Students'\nworksthree long essaysare critiqued in a workshop format. The course is for\nstudents with experience in writing workshops, fiction writers and poets who\nwant to explore another genre, and writers who enjoy\nexpressing ideas through the lens of personal experience. Those who bring\nknowledge from other disciplines are encouraged to apply. This course is restricted to students who have taken at least one\nprevious Written Arts course (in any genre: fiction, poetry, or nonfiction).

        "description": "There is waking life, and then there is another \"stage\" on\nwhich dreams take place, as Sigmund Freud memorably wrote in The Interpretation of Dreams. In this\ncourse, we will read influential and compelling dream narratives, with a focus\non German-language literature and culture. How are dreams narrated, and how is\ntheir relation to the rest of life conceived? What is the logic of dreams\naccording to Freud, and how does Freud interpret dreams? We will consider the\nrole of language in both the representation and analysis of dreams. As a\ncounterpoint, we will read troubling scenes of awakening in order to advance\nour own \"Interpretation of Waking Up\". Texts we will read include\nGenesis 37-45, Freud's Interpretation of\nDreams, Kafka's notebooks, Adorno's Dream\nNotes, selections from Mann's Magic\nMountain, and Walter Benjamin's Berlin Childhood around 1900. Films\nby Herzog and Hitchcock. Students will work regularly on creative and critical\nwriting assignments in order to gain confidence and skill in writing in German.\nConversations in class will be oriented toward making the transition from\nIntermediate II or the equivalent to the 300-level, while the course is also\nappropriate for students who have already taken a 300-level course.

        "department": "german",
        "description": "The German Baroque is\nperhaps best known for the presence of mourning and melancholy in its literary\ntexts. Writers in 17th-century Germany inherited and transmitted Medieval and Renaissance\ntheories of affect during a time of political and religious tumult as they\ndeveloped a new literary language. 20th-century readers of Walter Benjamin's\ndecisive study, The Origin of the German\nMourning Play, have looked to the Baroque as a primal scene of modernity.\nYet few readers of Benjamin have read his sources, while Baroque specialists\nhave tended not to take \"theory\" into account. In this course we will read key\npoems and plays from the German Baroque period in dialogue with passages from\nBenjamin's study. We will attempt to define the concepts of mourning and\nmelancholy for ourselves, and in doing so consider associated concepts in the\nBaroque/Benjamin constellation: the sovereign, the doctrine of Saturn, and\nallegory. In lyric poetry, we will consider the themes of transience and\nvanity. We will then turn to visual art, and study Albrecht D\u00fcrer's Melencolia I together with Panofsky and\nSaxl's important essay on this work. Finally, we will read W.G. Sebald's The Rings of Saturn, in order to reflect\non the traces left by the Baroque in late 20th century literature. Authors we\nwill read include Gryphius, Lohenstein, Tscherning, Luther, Benjamin, Panofsky,\nand Sebald. Taught in German. Class\nsize: 16",

        "department": "german",
        "description": "Cross-listed: Art History; German Studies 8 credits\nAccording\nto the political scientist Francis Fukuyama 1989 marked the \"end of history.\"\nThe so-called triumph of Western-style capitalism and liberal democracy,\nfrequently represented by the fall of the Berlin Wall, meant that there would\nbe no more struggle and no more contestation: a single ideology would now\ndominate the world. But is this true? Today we find ourselves in a world in\nurgent need of re-imagining the ways we wish to live together. The radical\nshift in the political order marked by 1989 had both temporal and spatial\neffects: in addition to a new sense of \"contemporaneity,\" the fall of borders\ncalled forth an imagination of a globalized \"whole earth.\" It was in the\ncontext of this new world order that visual artists, writers, and theorists\nbegan to offer alternative narratives to this global shake-up. Focusing on\nquestions of history, identity, memory, and site, for these cultural figures\n1989 marked less the \"end of history\" than the emergence of new stories. Does\nthe current historical moment of 2017 with its re-emergence of aggressive\nnationalism, authoritarian government, and threat to plurality confront us with\nanother turning point to possibly bookend the momentum of opening, diversity,\nand new beginnings after 1989? This course will seek to map the connections\nbetween post-1989 practices and their wider historical moment up to the\npresent. We will discuss, among others, artworks by Hans Haacke, Hito Steyerl,\nand Ilya Kabakov, poetry and prose by Ingo Schulze, Terezia Mora, and Nobel\nPrize winner Herta M\u00fcller as well as theoretical writings by Bruno Latour,\nJean-Luc Nancy, William Kentridge, and \u00e9douard Glissant. The class will\nscrutinize pivotal films created in response to 1989, and we will visit with\ncontemporary artists and filmmakers. In concert with our weekly class\nconversations, this course will foster various formats of presentations and\ncollaborative work, combining analytical and creative modes of engaging with\nthe diverse materials.

From Harlequin's mask to learned\ncomedy, from operatic gesture to tragic endings, we will study texts, watch\nperformances, listen to music, and perform ourselves. One of the primary goals\nof this course is to put the Italian Renaissance into dialogue with broad\ntheatrical traditions, from ancient to modern, and to understand these modes as\never-changing cultural currency. Renaissance theater illuminates not only\nItalian culture and society, but also broader, transnational cultural trends\nand mores, some of which persist even today. Texts will include Machiavelli's\nplay La Mandragola, pastoral plays, excerpts\nfrom epic texts, and stage directions for commedia dell'arte\nproductions. This course constitutes a first introduction to Italian\ncivilization and culture for students who have completed Intermediate Italian.\nThrough in-class discussions, grammar drills, written work, presentations, and\nperformances, it offers an opportunity for students to hone their linguistic\nskills and actively engage with the rich world of Italian Renaissance theater.

Naturally, it\nfaltered, it broke, toyed even with that possibility of silence that grazes\nnonsense. Spanish poetry in the late 1920s and early 1930s was symptomatically\ntorn between its allegiance to the dehumanizing principles of the Avant-Garde\nand the growing pressures of political commitment deriving from a shifting, and\nconfusing landscape. Against this horizon, Surrealism emerged as the last\nexpression, the last \"snapshot\" of the European intelligentsia, and its promise\nto suture all wounds. Around the eventful year of 1929, a number of the most\nrelevant Spanish poets of the 20th Century attuned their voices in the strident\nsurrealist key. In this course, we will read, among other fascinatingly\ndifficult, untranslatable books, Poeta en\nNueva York, by Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca, Sobre\nlos \u00e1ngeles and Yo era un tonto...,\nby Rafael Alberti, Un R\u00edo, un Amor,\nby Luis Cernuda, and Espadas como labios,\nby Vicente Aleixandre.

We will cover the scientific\nmethod generally, and more specifically how it is applied to the process of\necological research. Students will gain skills in\" developing ecological\nquestions; formulating testable hypotheses; designing experiments; collecting\nand analyzing data; and presenting results in both oral and written formats.\nThese skills will be learned through a hands-on process in which students\nconduct a series of individual and collaborative field studies that test core\nhypotheses in the science of ecology, with special focus on the tropical forest\necosystem. We will study a broad spectrum of species (e.g. microbes,\nplants, insects, vertebrates), comparing the methods used to study them. Field\ntechniques may include biomass and diversity estimates of rainforest trees,\nculturing endophytic fungi, sampling macroinvertebrates in fresh-water streams,\nmist-netting bats, line-transects and acoustic sampling of frogs, sweep-netting\nand pitfall trapping of insects, mark and recapture to estimate population size\nof butterflies, estimating biomass removed by leafcutters, and mapping the\nspatial distribution leaf-cutter ant mounds. This course concludes with a\nmandatory field trip to Costa Rica over spring break. Entry into the course\ndetermined by application. Financial support available.

At the nanoscale, thermal noise and Brownian\nmotion dominate over forces that we experience every day such as gravity and\ninertia. Thus, a major focus will be to analyze the common molecular level\ndesign principlesratcheting mechanisms that occur both in biological machines\nand artificial systems. During the course we will explore interesting topics\nranging from the historical development of molecular machines, focused on\ncontrolling the motion about a single bond, to the more recent examples of\nartificial motors, ribosomes, pumps and the development of new non equilibrium\nmaterials. This will be a seminar style course utilizing primary literature.\nPrerequisites: Chemistry 202 or by permission of the instructor. Class\nsize: 12",

        "department": "psychology",
        "description": "Cross-listed: Human Rights; Social Studies It has now been more than fifty years since the original work\nof Stanley Milgram demonstrated the remarkable and very widely unpredicted and\nunexpected finding that large numbers of individuals in multiple samples of\nAmerican men and women studied were willing to \"punish\" another\nperson when ordered to do so by an experimenter; this in the stated but false\ncontext of a psychology experiment on learning and memory. The prominence of the initial work and the continued\nsalience of such study and accumulated findings in the domain of social\npsychology cannot be over-stated. And\nit very much has not reached the stage of dormancy as the publication of\nstudies, literature reviews and conferences on the topic of obedience to\nauthority continue to appear in unabated fashion. It is even the case that as recently as six\nyears ago a replication of the original study, with slight modifications, and with concordant\nresults was published (J. Burger, January 2009). Further revealing of prominence is that fact\nthat a relatively new full-length movie version of the original study (a\nbiopic) appeared this year. In addition,\na diligent search of current psychology or cross-disciplinary archives uncovers\nfurther studies that provide evidence that obedience and indeed destructive\nobedience is very much prevalent in our society and in many others as well and\nin a myriad of contexts. The domain of\nthe \"Milgram study\" is especially worthy of continuing interest. This because of the vastness of both\ncriticism and praise of the original work but also because of historical and\nsignificant events in the intervening years between 1960s and stretching to our\ncurrent time. The continuing study of\nobedience is vital for the betterment of institutions, even in a democratic\nsociety. Social scientists should and\nmust find a way to safely and ethically investigate the conditions that promote\ndestructive obedience and thereby begin to learn the rudiments of how such can\nbe minimized. This is a college\nseminar. It is not limited to psychology\nor social studies or for that matter majors in any particular discipline. The two criteria for membership are a\nwillingness to read with care and then with conviction share with others the\nresults of such reading and study. Over\nthe course of the semester a sizable portion of the work contained in the body\nof the obedience literature is reviewed.\nAdmission by permission of the instructor. Class size:\n10",

The answer is far from obvious.\nIndeed, most of our knowledge is counter-intuitive. We know the earth goes\naround the sun, not the converse, but that's not the way it seems. All too\noften seeing is misleading, and our contemporary grasp of reality is rooted\ninstead in deep thinking and testable models. The course goal is to achieve a\nbetter appreciation of our extraordinary intellectual capacity to explain\ncomplex phenomena by discovering compact descriptions, preferably ones having\npredictive power. The course plan involves grappling with five transformative\nideas that shaped modern science and changed the way we now see the world. In\naddition, we will examine a promising but ultimately incorrect hypothesis and\nan unsolved problem that is currently under investigation. Our continuing focus\nwill be: (1) What does it mean to explain something quantitatively, and (2) How\ndo we test the validity of that explanation. Today, the computer is our most\nversatile tool for developing models. Accordingly, the course includes a\nrelated, two-tiered computer modeling lab, for which students will self-select\ninto either a beginner or more advanced group.

In April 1986, the nuclear power plant in Chernobyl, Ukraine\nsuffered a major technical problem leading to a meltdown in the reactor core.\nThe radiation release and ensuing clean-up operation required the Soviet\nauthorities to evacuate a large local region, affecting millions of people and\nleaving a region which is mostly uninhabited to this day. Chernobyl remains the\nworst civilian nuclear accident in history and its aftermath offers scientific,\nsocial, and political insights. This \"big ideas\" course will take an\ninterdisciplinary approach to the meaning of Chernobyl: it will explore the\nissue of nuclear power, the social and technological aspects of the plant's\nconstruction and operation, what led to the accident, the authorities' response\nto it, and the environmental and social impacts on the region since that time.\nLaboratory sessions will focus on the physics of nuclear power and radiation,\nthe biological effect of radiation, and the environmental impact of the\nChernobyl accident. Parallel consideration will be given to its implications\nfor Soviet governance, nuclear energy and proliferation, and the social impacts\nof Chernobyl and human-created nuclear and non-nuclear disasters. Examining\nthis event in readings, lectures, and laboratory investigations will foster a\ndeeper appreciation of the complex and interconnected contexts in which such\ndisasters must be studied in order to be understood. The course will feature\nguest lectures in science, politics, human rights and literature, speaking on\nissues arising from the accident. Class\nsize: 16",

Before 1750 our\nsite, the German minister's home (or Parsonage) was the scene of visits from\nMohicans, likely from a Moravian mission village in the Taconic hills east of\nBard, their last settlement in New York. African Americans lived at the site as\nslaves by the 1780s. We have found traces of spiritual practices for protection\nand healing. In the mid-1800s, several free African American families\nestablished a neighborhood nearby that lasted until the early 20th Century. We'll\ndo 3.5-hour excavation and/or lab sessions on Friday or weekend afternoons\nbefore mid-term to find more evidence of ritual concealments and study\nbackground texts to write short papers for weekly seminar, working at times\nwith local middle school students.

From Lewis\nHenry Morgan's portrait of the American beaver, to E. E. Evans-Pritchard's\naccount of the cattle beloved in Nuer society, animals have always been an\nessential part of how we see ourselves and make sense of the world around us.\nThis course traces the discipline's engagement over the past century with the\nfigure of the animal. We begin by exploring some of the discipline's classic\ntexts in relation to animals, focusing on their role as repositories of totemic\npower, markers of purity and pollution, and mirrors of social identity. We then\nturn to contemporary studies of animal-based practices such as whaling,\nhunting, captive animal display, and conservation as sites of construction for\nracialized, gendered, and classed differences. The final section of the course\nfocuses on multispecies ethnography, an approach attuned to the entanglements\nbetween human and nonhuman beings, and how their livelihoods are shaped by\ncultural, political, and economic forces. Through a multispecies approach, we\nconsider viral clouds, were-jaguars, laboratory animals, pit bull advocacy, and\nthe militarization of the honeybee among other topics.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Africana Studies; American Studies; Human Rights;\nMiddle Eastern Studies Since the\neighteenth century, childhood and youth have often been understood as times of\nhappiness, innocence, and closeness to nature distinct from adulthood. At the\nsame time, many writers, activists, and policymakers have witnessed young\npeople in conditions of violence, toil, and poverty, and they have spoken of\n\"youth at risk,\" \"lost generations,\" or even \"children without childhood.\" How\ncan we make sense of these portrayals of young people's lives? Do worries about\n\"children without childhood\" offer a picture contrary to the romantic view\nof youth, or do they instead subscribe to it? How did ideas about a separate\nand happy childhood become so prevalent in the first place, and how do they\ncompare with young people's actual experiences? Finally, how are recent changes\nin young people's lives related to larger political-economic transformations\nand deepening structures of inequality? This course will address these and\nother questions through an examination of young people in a variety of\nhistorical and geographic contexts, although much of our focus will be devoted\nto the contemporary U.S. and Middle East. In addition, the class will include a\nsmall-scale ethnographic project that will allow students to conduct fieldwork\non some aspect of youth cultural production on or near the Bard campus.\nThroughout the course, a key point of emphasis will be that young people are\nnot the passive recipients of tradition, but resourceful social actors who help\nto re-create ways of acting, thinking, and feeling. At the same time, they are\nnot merely the targets of policy, but actively contribute, sometimes in\nunexpected ways, to social and political change. Class size: 22",

        "description": "Cross-listed: Experimental Humanities; Science, Technology &\nSociety Modern\nideologies of voice - deployed in politics, social movements and humanitarian organizations,\nas well as many musical and cultural productions  tend to naturalize the\nrelationship between voice and individuality, agency, and empowerment. The voice, it is assumed, provides unmediated\nand immediate access to the self and a direct way of making one's desires and\nideas known in public. But the immediacy\nof the voice often depends upon specific media and/or technologies that make\nspecific voices audible, such as sound recording, amplification, broadcasting,\nas well as institutional divisions of labor through which voices are\nrepresented, cited, and invoked. In this\ncourse, we will explore a range of conduits of voice that re-present an\noriginal voice through technological means  radio, telephone captioning, voice\nrecorders  and/or human means \ninterpreters/translators, voice-over artists, spirit possession, and\nstenographers. Through these\nexplorations we will trouble some of the assumptions about the directness of\nvoice, even as we discover how the feelings and sense of immediacy is produced.\nDrawing inspiration from philosopher Gilbert Ryle's notion of the ghost in the\nmachine' to critique mind-body distinctions, the course will broadly ask\nstudents to think critically about the relationship of human self and voice to\ntechnologies and practices that animate and circulate voices. Students will be required to research a\nspecific conduit of voice' and create both a research paper and an EH-inspired\nproject that demonstrates their knowledge about this voice and its medium. They\nwill be asked to contribute readings to the class related to their specific\nproject. Class size:\n15",

We attend also to\nemergent ethnographic forms and methods, such as multi-sited ethnography,\ncritical moral anthropology, and indigenous methodologies and critiques. To\ncomplement the fieldwork projects, we will also read exemplary, and sometimes\ncontroversial, texts of ethnography in practice.

It focuses largely on France, Britain, and America, with a particular\ninterest in institutional organization, appointments and promotion, training,\ndress, and public media. Students will be encouraged to think comparatively and\nglobally (e.g., Brazil, South Africa, Palestine, India). We consider the early\npolice as an expression of sovereign right and later of citizens' rights, from\nenforcer of the king's will to public servant. Changing ideas of security and\norder not only undergird the history of the police but have in turn developed\nthrough police practices. We observe how resistance to diverse forms of\npolicing enters into civil and human rights discourses almost from the start.\nThe course is organized chronologically and around public space, such as: the market, food security, and price regulation;\nthe port and contraband; the urban street, vice, and violence; the border, the\nroad, highwaymen, and fugitives; state-subsidized housing and the problems of\npublicness and domesticity; the neighborhood and resistance to policing; and\nthe more abstract (due to long-range and remote surveillance technologies)\nsites of early international cooperation to state and international\ninvestigative agencies, such as the FBI, MI 6, and Interpol. In these spaces,\nwe study the vulnerabilities of individual bodies (including police agents')\nand social groups that resulted from the institutional growth of the police.\nBeyond bold acts in the service of order or outstanding acts of resistance, we\nconsider how the policed world contributed to evolving ideas of citizenship and\npersonhood.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Literature Although\nit concerns only the single day of June 16th, 1904, each chapter of James\nJoyce's Ulysses is written in a\nradically different historical and literary style. This course will complement\nJoyce's stylistic innovation by using contemporary documents (newspaper\naccounts, advertising, folksongs, etc.) and historical texts (epics, medieval chronicles, a variety of\nearly and late modern histories) to unfold the historical context and resonance\nof each of Joyce's chapters. We will\nexamine how these various means of casting the reader in time and history\nilluminate the modernism and political reality of Dublin in 1904. Our\nparticular focus will be the three \"nets\" of power -- organized religion,\nimperialism, and ethnic nationalism -- that Joyce feared would enthrall him and\nwhich led to his strategic exile from Ireland. Key issues addressed will be the\nfunction of historical and mythical time in everyday life, Joyce's narrative as\nan anti-nationalist (yet, somehow, nationalist) epic, the role of popular\nscientific writing and technology in modernism, the politics of gender and\nsexuality in the fin-de-si\u00e8cle, the function of terrorism in politics, and the\neffect of politics and mass media on \"personal\" experience. Although demanding\nin its range, this course has no prerequisites other than a familiarity with\nthe Odyssey; admission preference is for motivated lower-college students. Class size: 18\n",

Sprawl.\nTypologies of suburbs abound as the historian seeks to comprehend the\nvarious transitions they have undergone in the popular imagination, in class\nand racial composition, and in relationship to their supposed opposites\"the\ncity\" and \"the country.\" Once a marker\nof refinement and status in the American mind, suburban life morphed to become\nsynonymous with oppressive conformity, racial exclusion, and gender\nrestrictions. Some of these\ncharacterizations continue today, but have been complicated by the rise of the\nboutique city even as blacks, new ethnic groups, and working class people are\nvoluntarily and sometimes involuntarily reshaping the landscape between urban\ncenters and bucolic countrysides. In\nthis course, readings will address these matters by exploring the complexities\nof historical suburbia in the U.S. from 1830 to the present. We will focus on several historical types: Romantic suburbs (early nineteenth to early\ntwentieth century), early industrial suburbs (late nineteenth and early\ntwentieth century), suburban dystopias (post-World War II through the 1960s), black suburbs (post 1960s), edge-city exurbs\nthat blur city/suburb distinctions and raisie environmental concerns (since the\n1980s), and emerging working class suburbs.\nIn addition to secondary sources on the topic, we will examine\nliterature, films, and illustrations depicting suburban life. As a Major Conference in History and Junior\nSeminar in American Studies, the course requires students to produce a 25-page\nresearch paper. Ideally, students\nenrolling in this course should have already taken American Urban History or City\nCultures, but these are not strict prerequisites.

        "department": "history",
        "description": "Cross-listed: German Studies;\nHuman Rights; Science, Technology, Society\nIn this research course, we will address the coercive and\nviolent powers of the modern state as they were refined through technologies\nand techniques in National Socialist Germany, and then alternately condemned\nand utilized in the two German nations of the (East) German Democratic Republic\n(DDR) and the (West) German Federal Republic (BRD). Topics\nwill range from the development of new techniques of propaganda and military\noversight to the manipulation of social technologies such as identification\npapers, the census, racial pseudo-science, and, most horrifically, the\nconcentration camp system. At the end of\nthe Nazi period, the DDR defined itself through its resistance to the Nazi\nparty, and nearly the entirety of its ideology was grounded in anti-Fascism and\ncosmopolitanism. The means of organizing and controlling society were\noften directly carried over from the Nazi past. Similarly, the liberal\ncapitalist ideology of the BRD defined itself in complete opposition to the\nNazi past, but here as well there were surprising number holdovers from the\nNazi era, ranging from the system of registering with the police to the\nretention of leading bureaucrats. By comparing the two movements,\nideologically complete opposites yet organizationally often surprisingly\nsimilar, we can address some of the most disturbing issues of modern techniques\nof social control. Similarly, protests within each system against\nspecific moments of state power  ranging from issues such as the use of the\ncensus and identity cards to methods of police surveillance and conscription \nwere frequently couched in terms of their links with the Nazi era. Please\nnote that the core of this course will be spent writing and refining an\nindependent historical research paper of approximately 35 pages in length.\nNo previous knowledge of German history is required, although students\nwithout such knowledge will need to set aside time for some background\nreading.

Special attention will be paid to the neighborhood of densest Jewish\nsettlement, the Lower East Side, and its spaces of residence, work, and\nleisure.

        "description": "Cross-listed: American Studies; Human Rights; Latin American\nStudies This\nresearch seminar will study the violent interactions between race, religion,\nand revolution in Latin America from the early twentieth-century to the\npresent, to understand how these interactions have mattered to the region's\nhistory and how they explain some of its most violent current conflicts. The\nvery name \"Latin America\" derived from and became associated with\nspecific racial, religious, and revolutionary meanings through a history of\nviolence. The seminar will begin by studying how racial concepts formed and\nbecame fixed ideas through distinct revolutionary-inspired intellectual debates\non interracial mixture and indigenous rights. Based in Mexico and Peru, the\nformation of concepts like global mestizaje, a \"cosmic race,\" and\nindigenismo involved rival valuations of each nation's indigenous and colonial\nhistories and cultures, with lasting effects. The seminar will then explore the\nsimultaneous rise of wars and conflicts over radically different religious\nmeanings and faiths, within and outside of Catholicism, including native\nreligions and the rise of Evangelical Protestant Christianity. The latter part\nof the seminar will focus on Guatemala, which dramatically combined extreme\nviolence over race, religion, and revolution, and focused global attention on\nindigenous rights and human rights. These histories will allow for a deeper\nunderstanding of the rise of different forms of violence in Central America\ntoday, and therefore of the current human rights, migrant, and refugee crisis\ncentered there and involving other parts of Latin America and the US. This\nseminar emphasizes the narratives, interpretations, and voices of participants\nin the history, and critical engagement with these primary sources in the writing\nof the history.",

To ask \"why\" of the world is to refuse to take the world as a\ngiven. Indeed, to ask \"why\" of the world is to begin to engage in the act of\nphilosophical thinking. The history of philosophy can be read as orbiting\naround a series of important \"why\" questions: Why being and not non-being? Why\ngood and not evil? Why suffering? Why death? Why God? Why me? Why philosophize?\nIn this course, we will explore these questions and the ways in which they have\nbeen articulated and answered throughout the history of Philosophy by reading\nmajor works by Plato, Descartes, Kant, Nietzsche, Freud, and Camus.

If there are both conceptual and non-conceptual ways that we make\nsense of reality, might we need a more robust form of realism? This course\noffers an introduction to contemporary philosopher Hubert L. Dreyfus, who spent\nmore than fifty years challenging the limits of our beliefs about perception,\naction, and human intelligence while introducing, clarifying, and putting into\nconversation continental and analytical-philosophical traditions. Readings\ninclude a range of Dreyfus' works, as well as texts by early and later\nHeidegger, Wittgenstein, Merleau-Ponty, Taylor, Searle, Rorty, and McDowell \nwhose thinking Dreyfus sometimes challenged and often reconfigured into\noriginal theories of embodiment, the nature of mind, the conditions of\npossibility of language, and the limits of relativism.",

From\nthere, we will turn to broader topics that cut across various art forms: Are\nserious (or \"high\") and popular (or \"low\") art to be understood and evaluated\ndifferently? How do we evaluate works of\nart, and why do we so often disagree on their value? And what, if anything, do the various items\nand activities that we classify as \"art\" have in common?

Questions we\nshall address include: what constitutes \"a people,\" in what sense can it be\nregarded as sovereign, and how is inclusion within, or exclusion from, this\ngroup determined? In what sense has rule by the people been regarded as\nlegitimate or good? In what sense and to what degree do institutions of\nrepresentation such as legislatures embody the ideal of popular sovereignty?\nHow is the will of the people conceptualized and expressed? What is the\nrelationship, if any, between \"public opinion\" and popular sovereignty? The\ncourse will encompass both theoretical analysis and empirical research, aiming\nto bring diverse modes of investigation into conversation. Readings will range\nfrom canonical texts of ancient and modern philosophy (e.g. Plato, Aristotle,\nHobbes, Locke, Rousseau, the Federalists, Tocqueville) to contemporary works in\nhistory, theory, and political science (e.g., Morgan, Key, Skinner, Young,\nMehta, Page & Shapiro, Igo).

What goals should we\nset ourselves? Can we control our emotions, and if so, how should we do it? Is\nvirtue possible, and how is it different from vice? But there is a special\nangle under which the course will address these questions, namely: what should\nwe not do and why? How do we deal with an offense or an enemy? Is one responsible for one's own trauma? Is there such a thing\nas vice? The paradox of our culture is that, focused as it is on enjoyment and\npersonal success, its political and social imaginary is filled with demonic\n\"axes of evil\" and the cultivated emotions are those of depression or anxiety.\nWhy is this happening? Are the current cultural rituals efficient in dealing\nwith unpleasant expectations and memories? What are the conditions of tolerance\nand the conditions of enmity? We will try to approach if not answer these\ndifficult questions during the course. An interdisciplinary set of readings\ncombines philosophy, psychology, and cultural studies. It includes such authors\nas St Augustine, Kant, Hegel, Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, Freud, Arendt, Levinas, iek, S. Forti, and others.

We begin the class with an examination of alienation,\nreification, and the call to revolutionary class-consciousness in the works of\nMarx and Luk\u00e1cs. These concepts provide a theoretical foundation for the\ntradition of critical theory that emerged from the so-called Frankfurt School\nin the works of Marcuse, Horkheimer, Adorno, and Benjamin. Alongside these\nthinkers we will examine post-industrial society, enlightenment reasoning, and critiques of\npower. Transitioning to the emergence of Poststructuralist thought, we will\nlook at some of the conceptual differences between Adorno's/Horkheimer's and\nFoucault's critique/s of reason. Following the historical transformations of\nradical political thought, we will survey how these traditions emerged and gave\nbirth to contemporary political theory in the works of Habermas and\nButler.

For even\nthe most casual observer of European and American politics, it is obvious that\nnationalism plays a foundational role in contemporary movements and\nideologies. It is important to note,\nhowever, that nationalism is not a recent phenomenon. Throughout the 20th\ncentury, nationalism remained a central animating factor of domestic and\ninternational politics. It is the time\nwhere the concept of the nation-state replaced alternative political\narrangements to become the dominant ordering principle in world politics. With the end of the Cold War and the apparent\nrise in globalization, many anticipated an emerging conflict between nations\nand statesa conflict that has manifested in a variety of ways. Nationalism intersects and overlaps countless\nother areas of political, social, and cultural concern.

We will investigate the intersection of\nnationalism and race, ethnicity, culture, gender, postcoloniality, and\nsubjectivity through authors such as Du Bois, Anderson, Brubaker, Butler, Puar,\nand Rankine. This course will be taught\nconcurrently at Bard's international partner institutions. Students will\nbenefit from collaboration with peers at these institutions, as well as have\nthe opportunity to engage students from these institutions on the issues raised\nby the class.

Students will gain an understanding of the basic goals,\nconstraints and structures of diplomacy: diplomatic corps, embassies, consulates,\naid missions, attaches, envoys and the use of non-traditional diplomats.\nThey will then examine the evolution of those components and contexts to\ninclude public diplomacy, cyber diplomacy, diplomacy in combat zones and the\nuse of international development as a foreign policy tool. Using selected\ndiplomatic crises as case studies, students will analyze the roles played by\ndifferent government agencies, militaries, international & regional\norganizations, the media, public interest groups, private foundations,\ncontractors, commercial interests, educational institutions, and law\nenforcement officials. Students will explore how nations communicate with each\nother in the 21st century (formally and informally) and will use in-class\nsimulations and videoconferences with students across the Bard international\nnetwork to explore the roles played by different actors in addressing immediate\ncrises and longer-term diplomatic issues.

How do we appear in public, and how does our sense\nof identity relate to our sense of self? This course strips down conventional\nnotions of political protest within the American context to critically inquire\nafter what motivates us to engage or disengage with politics. Today it seems\nthat many social movements revolve around what we call identity politics,\ncalling into question sex, gender, and race. If everything has become\npolitical, then is anything political? What does it mean to act from a moral\ncenter? What courage does it require? Key texts in this course will include:\nPaul Tillich's The Courage to Be, Erich Fromm's To Have or To Be, Hannah Arendt's\nchapter on \"Action\" from The Human Condition and essay \"Civil Disobedience\".\nWe'll explore the practice of political resignation in Henry David Thoreau's\nWalden and essay \"Civil Disobedience\", Theodor Adorno's Lectures on Moral\nPhilosophy (What it means to be an American-joiner), Emily Dickinson's poetry,\nWendell Berry's \"The Mad Farmer Liberation Front\", and Sheldon S. Wolin on\n\"Political Theory as Vocation\" and invocation. We'll also look at the art of\npolitical dissent in Thomas Paine's Common Sense, MLK's letters, and the\ntradition of Conscientious Objection in American political history.

        "department": "politicalstudies",
        "description": "Cross-listed: Gender and Sexuality Studies; Global &\nInternational Studies; Human Rights Security is one of the foundational concepts in the\nstudy of international politics. As the principal rationale for war, the quest for\nsecurity influences both states' behavior in the international system as well\nas the structure of state and society relations in domestic politics. Too\noften, however, the meaning of security is taken for granted in the study of\ninternational relations, with individuals, societies and states homogenized\ninto one coherent model that focuses exclusively on the threat, use and control\nof military force. This seminar will\ninterrogate this narrow concept of security by engaging with a diverse\nliterature in international relations termed \"critical security studies.\" The critical security studies research agenda\naims to denaturalize the common understandings of security that dominate the\nfield of international relations and in doing so shows how security is socially\nconstructed through specific and historically contingent political practices,\nwhich create shared social understandings and endow subjects with identities\nand interests. Some of the broad\ntheoretical themes covered include how threats to security are defined and\nrepresented, gendered and feminist approaches to security, the emergence and\neffects of dominant discourses of security and the politics of threat\nconstruction. We will then apply the\ninsights of the critical security studies approach to the contemporary security\nenvironment in the United States through a critical examination of the war on\nterrorism. The course ends with a\ndiscussion of the ethics of national security by looking at the politics of torture,\nhuman rights and the suspension of civil liberties in the state of exception.

We begin with an exploration of the so-called third\nwave of democratization, the wave of democratic transitions which brought\ndemocracy to some three-dozen nations between 1974 and 1992 in Western Europe,\nLatin America, Central and Eastern Europe, and Asia and Africa, taking note of\nsuch domestic and external developments as the postwar economic boom, the rise\nof the international human rights regime, and the advent of globalization. In\nthe second part of the seminar we will examine the uneven legacy of the third\nwave, especially the rise of illiberal democracy in Latin America, creeping\nauthoritarianism across the post-Communist world, and the failure of democracy\nto reach the Middle East, and the cultural, economic and political factors\ncontributing to these outcomes--from persistent poverty and inequality, to the\nrise of radical Islam, to uneven support for democracy by the US and the international\ncommunity. We conclude by examining the challenges to democracy in the\ndeveloped West, especially therise of Trumpism in the U.S., and what this\nmight mean for the so-called liberal international order. Signaled by the\nUnited Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and international\nfinancial institutions such as the World Bank and the IMF, this order is\nusually credited with making the world safe for democracy in the postwar era.

The course is\ndivided into three parts. In the first part\nof the course, we explore the emergence of the modern presidency as the central\ninstitution of the American political system.\nIn addition to the founding, we will give special attention to the\nJeffersonian, Jacksonian, and Progressive Eras as well as the expansion of\nexecutive power under FDR. Throughout\nthis first part of the course we will also examine how the presidency developed\nvarious powers beyond the formal constitutional responsibilities of the office,\nincluding party leadership, control of the executive branch, and relations with\nthe public. In the second part of the course, we will critically explore the\noperation of the modern presidency from FDR to the present. In particular, we\nwill see how modern presidents contend with multiple, and, at times,\nconflicting roles and responsibilities (party leader, chief executive,\ncommander in chief, media celebrity, world leader) in an increasingly complex\npolitical environment. In the third part of the course, we will consider the\nproblem of contemporary presidential power.\nIn particular, we will ask whether presidential power is enlarged or\ndiminished in the present era of hyper-partisanship, intensified media culture,\neconomic and ecological volatility, and the shifting geopolitical environment\nconfronting the United States. We will also ask what role presidential power\nand leadership should play in the life of contemporary American democracy.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Human\nRights; Social Studies It has now been more than fifty years since the original\nwork of Stanley Milgram demonstrated the remarkable and very widely unpredicted\nand unexpected finding that large numbers of individuals in multiple samples of\nAmerican men and women studied were willing to \"punish\" another\nperson when ordered to do so by an experimenter; this in the stated but false\ncontext of a psychology experiment on learning and memory. The prominence of the initial work and the\ncontinued salience of such study and accumulated findings in the domain of\nsocial psychology cannot be over-stated.\nAnd it very much has not reached the stage of dormancy as the\npublication of studies, literature reviews and conferences on the topic of\nobedience to authority continue to appear in unabated fashion. It is even the case that as recently as six\nyears ago a replication of the original study, with slight modifications, and with concordant\nresults was published (J. Burger, January 2009). Further revealing of prominence is that fact\nthat a relatively new full-length movie version of the original study (a\nbiopic) appeared this year. In addition,\na diligent search of current psychology or cross-disciplinary archives uncovers\nfurther studies that provide evidence that obedience and indeed destructive obedience\nis very much prevalent in our society and in many others as well and in a\nmyriad of contexts. The domain of the\n\"Milgram study\" is especially worthy of continuing interest. This because of the vastness of both\ncriticism and praise of the original work but also because of historical and\nsignificant events in the intervening years between 1960s and stretching to our\ncurrent time. The continuing study of\nobedience is vital for the betterment of institutions, even in a democratic\nsociety. Social scientists should and\nmust find a way to safely and ethically investigate the conditions that promote\ndestructive obedience and thereby begin to learn the rudiments of how such can\nbe minimized. This is a college\nseminar. It is not limited to psychology\nor social studies or for that matter majors in any particular discipline. The two criteria for membership are a\nwillingness to read with care and then with conviction share with others the\nresults of such reading and study. Over\nthe course of the semester a sizable portion of the work contained in the body\nof the obedience literature is reviewed.\nAdmission by permission of the instructor. Class size:\n10",

It considers foundational theories that emerged\nfrom the social upheavals of modernization in the 19th Century, including those\nof Marx, Weber, Durkheim, Simmel, and DuBois. The course thus introduces many\nenduring themes of sociology: alienation and anomie; social structure and\ndisorganization; group conflict and solidarity; secularization and\nindividualism; bureaucracy and institutions, the division of labor, capitalism,\nand the nature of authority. We then follow these conversations into the\ncontemporary era, examining traditions such as functionalism, conflict theory,\nrational choice, symbolic interactionism, feminist theory, and critical theory,\nincluding thinkers such as G.H. Mead, Robert Merton, Pierre Bourdieu, J\u00fcrgen\nHabermas, and Michel Foucault. Students will learn the key concepts of major\ntheoretical approaches in sociology, and will consider questions such as the\nrelationship between theory and research, and the relationship of social\nconditions to the production of knowledge.

The amount and type of\npunishment found in society is not a simple, direct result of crime patterns.\nRather, to understand how and why we punish, we must examine the ways that\nhistorical processes, social structures, institutions, and culture shape penal\npractices as well as how systems of punishment shape society. This course draws\non sociological and historical research to explore the social functions of\npunishment, its cultural foundations and meanings, what drives changes in how\nwe punish, the relationship between penal practices and state power, and the\nrole of crime control in reproducing race, gender, and class inequality. The\nclass also delves deeply into the theoretical and empirical debates about the\npunitive turn in American criminal justice over the last 4 decades. We consider\nthe causes and consequences of mass incarceration, the racial disparities in\nthe system, the drug war, changes in policing, the politicization of crime, and\nthe role of criminal justice in the welfare state.

Second, we will contextualize\nenvironmental problems in relation to various inequalities: between different\ncountries and world regions, and with respect to race, nationality,\ncitizenship, gender and class. Here, we will pay close attention to theoretical\napproaches viewing the logics of capitalism and of colonial oppression as key\ncauses of ecological problems.

This course explores the\ntheoretical debates and practical policy effects of non-state actors in\ninternational affairs. How should we define non-state actors?

What strategies do different non-state actors use to\ninfluence policy-making? What role do non-state actors play in global\ngovernance? The goal of the course is to provide students with a working\nknowledge of the major academic debates and controversies about the definition,\nemergence and evolution of non-state actors in international affairs. We will\ninvestigate the changing roles and influence of non-state actors in a variety\nof issue areas, including global governance, security affairs, human rights,\npublic health, international development and international economics, among\nothers.

We\nwill take advantage of our New York\n  City location with guest speakers from a wide spectrum\nof organizations within the field, such as the United Nations, US State\nDepartment, Human Rights Watch, Council on Foreign\nRelations, World Policy Institute, Open Society Foundation, Central American\nLegal Assistance, Control Risks Group, East/West Institute, Asia Society and\nmany others.

Visits to local sites and to New York City will also be part of the class. Class size: 22 (1800-present, Americas)",

It considers art and architecture within dynamic contexts of cultural conflict and exchange. Designed to introduce students to art traditionally categorized as \"Early Christian,\" \"Byzantine,\" \"Romanesque,\" and \"Islamic,\" the course also encourages students to question critically these designations. Looking at art created by Christian, Jewish, Muslim, and \"pagan\" communities, it examines the role of the Mediterranean Sea as a boundary and a crossroad in the development of urban centers around its periphery. Topics include the relationship between centers and margins, secular and religious spheres, and majority and minority cultures. Particular focus will be placed on areas of cultural exchange such as Spain, Tunisia, Egypt, Sicily, Constantinople (Istanbul), and Jerusalem. Coursework includes regular quizzes, Moodle posts, and two 5-7 page papers. Class size: 22 (Ancient, Europe) ",

        "description": "Cross-listed: Environmental & Urban Studies, American Studies\nThis course looks at the visual culture of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century New Amsterdam (New York City) and its namesake, the Dutch shipping capital Amsterdam. Amsterdam emerged as a global power in the early seventeenth century, having replaced Antwerp as the northern European center of capital and trade. With the help of the extraordinarily successful East and West India companies, the Dutch began exploring and colonizing locations throughout the world, including lower Manhattan. Although the Dutch surrendered New Amsterdam to the British in 1667, they maintained a vibrant presence in New York for decades, shaping the growing city as well as its environs (including the Hudson Valley) well into the nineteenth century. We will look at how images and objects produced in both contexts during this time shaped ideas about nationhood, citizenship, and early modern science, and consider how colonial relationships are forged through representation. Taught at Bard with three visits to New York City and interaction with the BHSECs in Queens and Newark. This is an ELAS class. Class size: 22 (1400-1800, Europe)",

While we regularly interact with our smartphones and computers, we tend to overlook how much we rely on visual aptitude to interpret what we encounter there. Rarely, if ever, do we think about how we navigate the visual world based on a shared vocabulary, gained over time, dependent in some cases on formal conventions with long histories. In this course, focused primarily on the early modern period, we\u2019ll study how images (paintings, drawings, and prints) and objects (primarily sculpture), practices central to the creation of images and objects, and visual technologies have shaped modes of seeing in the west from the fourteenth to eighteenth centuries.

Beginning with the writings of Diderot and Baudelaire, we will consider the emergence of art criticism as a response to the public forum of the Salon exhibition and, subsequently, its relationship to other sites of presentation. We will also look at art criticism alongside other forms of writing, including film and cultural criticism, and consider models such as those of the poet-critic and the artist-critic. Towards the end of the course we will look at the historical moment in which criticism became increasingly embroiled with theory. We will conclude by focusing on the current crisis of criticism. As the status of the public has changed we will ask how the role of criticism has transformed as well. Throughout the course we will ask the question, What can art criticism do?

We will consider how filmic sounds are different from images and music and pay particular attention to human voices as soundmakers. We will also investigate the complex relationship of sound to the real and imagined spaces they activate, how sound design suggests modes of time and tense, and we will consider the roles silence and music play in filmmaking. During the course of the semester these conversations will inform the making of our own timed-based media --with particular emphasis on sound design.

Yet in mid-17th century Venice, at the beginning of its history, opera was showbiz par excellence. Operas by Cavalli, Sacrati and Monteverdi\u2014and their production and reception\u2014far closer resemble today\u2019s Broadway musicals than contemporary opera does. The course offers a comparative study of one of the best known early baroque operas, Monteverdi\u2019s L\u2019incoronazione di Poppea (1642), and the new Broadway hit, Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s Hamilton (2015). Both works are based on a historical narrative (one on the story of the eccentric ancient Roman emperor Nero, as described by Tacitus, the other on the American founding father, Alexander Hamilton, as described by historian Ron Chernow), both play with the conventions of the respective genres (Monteverdi with the standard operatic forms such as lament, lullaby, love duet, while Miranda pairs Broadway style with hip-hop), both use an elevated form of speech in the dialogues (one the recitative, the other rap), and both offer the audience an irresistible musico-dramatic experience.

We will consider ways to listen deeply and to write critically about music. We will examine how music has been represented in the past and how it is variously represented today, and will develop ethnographic research and writing skills. We will ask questions about the utility and value of music as a commodity in our everyday lives and in our globalized world. We will debate the ethics of musical appropriations and collaborations. We will examine both the foundational questions of the discipline (addressing debates about musical authenticity, musical origins, universals, comparative frameworks, and the preservationist ethos) as well as recent subjects of ethnomusicological concern. Topics will include: media and technology; post-colonial issues; music and language; hybridity; circulation and consumption; music and labor; music and gender; and the relevance of music to contemporary indigenous politics and human rights.

        "description": "Sonata form is the most pervasive collective achievement in European music, running from the early 18th century on and still influencing the way much music is written today. It was considered such a natural phenomenon that it was discussed as having been \"discovered,\" not merely invented by humans, yet in many ways it was an artificial formula that killed as much music as it enlivened. This analysis course will study sonata form in its glorious heyday, before it was officially labeled by A.B. Marx in 1828. We'll start with simple binary forms of Kuhnau and Sammartini, proceeding through works of C.P.E. Bach, Haydn, Clementi, Mozart, Dussek, Beethoven, Hummel, and Schubert, with Schumann and Brahms as an epilogue. The course will be graded on two analysis papers and weekly analysis of sonatas and symphonies given in class. It fulfills a theory requirement for music majors and is intended for musicians who have had Theory 1 and 2 or the equivalent, but any interested and qualified student is welcome. Class size: 22",

        "department": "music",
        "description": "In the 1920\u2019s, a number of new electronic instruments such as the Theremin, the Ondes Martenot, and the Trautonium were invented, and a number of composers, including Hindemith and Messiaen, composed new works for them. After the invention of magnetic recording tape in the late 40\u2019s electronic music became an enterprise that was produced in special studios and fixed on tape for later playback. Starting around 1960, John Cage and David Tudor began experimental performances with such works as Cartridge Music (1960), Variations II and other pieces that reintroduced the live performer to the electronic medium. Many composers, such as Mumma, Behrman, Lucier, Ashley, Stockhausen, Nono, and Boulez, as well as collective improvisationally-based groups such as AMM Music in London, and Musica Elettronica Viva in Rome soon followed suit. During the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s, with the advent of smaller and the more personal synthesizers invented by Moog, Buchla and others, the field of live electronic music became a practical reality. Some ten years later, a similar sequence of events took place with regard to computer music, where the large mainframes of the 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s were superseded by the PC revolution of the late 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s. This was followed by the more recent development of the laptop that has enabled performers to carry powerful, portable computers on stage. This course will trace these developments, examine the literature of the field, encourage live performances of \"classic\" pieces, and the creation and performance of new compositions and improvisations. It is strongly recommended that this course be taken in conjunction with Electro-Acoustic Ensemble. This course counts towards the music history requirement for music majors. Class size: 16",

        "department": "music",
        "description": "For thirty years postmodern has been a notoriously difficult term to apply in music with any consistency. The late theorist Jonathan Kramer, though, advanced a view that postmodern is less a musical attribute than a style of listening, and his posthumous book Postmodern Music, Postmodern Listening represents the most profound work available on the topic. This course will use that book as a text, and will explore issues such as, what does it mean when we mix different styles in a piece of music? How do we know when to listen ironically? Is surreal music possible? Can music reorder our sense of linear time? Is postmodern music inherently a critique of modernism, or a new historical period? We\u2019ll be listening critically, sometimes ironically, to works from Charles Ives and Carl Nielsen to John Cage to John Adams to George Rochberg to John Zorn and beyond, basically constructing a philosophical framework for justifying musical style choices in the 21st century. Coursework will include two research papers, additional readings, and plenty of class and Moodle discussion. Some prior acquaintance with musical analysis will prove helpful, and we will be reading musical scores in class, though compensatory skills in other areas might successfully substitute. This course fulfills a music theory requirement for music majors. Class size: 22",

This fact has distorted both how we see Bach and the music of his age. The course attempts to put Bach back into his own time, giving an insight into the musical and cultural contexts in which Bach worked. After two general introductory classes, the course surveys the most important genres that Bach cultivated. His sonatas, concertos, suites, organ works and cantatas will be compared with those of his fellow composers Corelli, Vivaldi, Handel, the French clavecinists and North-German organists. Vocal music will be the topic of three subsequent classes, then the focus will be put on more theoretical issues such as what kind of contrapuntal and formal mechanisms work beneath the surface of Bach\u2019s music. Questions of a more aesthetic nature will appear at the end the course: how Bach treated the texts he set to music, how and why he built up carefully designed sets and cycles from his works, and where to place him in the aesthetic landscape of the early 18th century.

Although catchy, the adage is utterly fallacious. As this course attempts to show, there was never agreement about the phenomenon of \"Rhythm\" in the whole of human history. Musical rhythm, like time, is more accurately considered a relativity -- notions of musical motion, pulse, and meter vary across locations, communities, and individuals. Indeed, musical time changes over the course of time itself. In a History of Rhythm, students will discover various definitions for \"The Beat,\" multiple meanings and practices that dictated \"good rhythm\" within various musical cultures. Weekly lectures focus on historical musical notation, pedagogical techniques, compositional trends, and performance practices. The class will also analyze musical manuscripts and first editions by Machaut, Monteverdi, Vivaldi, Beethoven, Stravinsky, and others. An ability to read music is required. Through the student's successful completion of a final project, this course can fulfill either the music history or theory requirement. Class size: 14",

The students pursue assignments that focus their attention on issues such as value contrast, warm and cool contrast, creating tonality, understanding the expressive and structural possibilities of the materiality of paint, as well as how all of these elements factor in the composition of form and space. The projects are sequenced in a way that the students move from a simple dialogue of light and dark and gradually begin to incorporate a fuller range of elements from the vocabulary of painting during the semester. Assignments are designed to promote a recognition that expression in painting is rooted in its form \u2013 color, light, materiality, composition, etc. While much of the work will be done from observation - still life, landscape (weather permitting) and model - there will be assignments that incorporate abstraction as well. There are no prerequisites for this studio class. Estimated cost of materials is $150-$200. *The Fund for Visual Learning provides material support to students on financial aid to help them with art supplies. Eligible students may apply for a non\u00admajor introductory grant up to but not exceeding $150 to cover the material supply kits for Level 1 Studio Arts classes at: http://blogs.bard.edu/fvl/. Sophomores, Juniors, and Seniors who have not previously received a non\u00admajor introductory grant may apply when registering for classes in the spring, and First Year students must apply when registering on Super Advising days.

Working in a spectrum from miniature to the scale of architecture and landscape, students will make a series of sculptural projects that challenge and shift our perception of what is big, and what is small, what is at the center, and what is at the margin, in our physical environment. The sculptural work of the class will be complemented with a series of readings, PowerPoint presentations, and discussions that investigate the manipulation of scale and perception by sculptors throughout history.

We will discuss light and air, weight, gravity, speed and tensions while addressing problems of scale and the potential power and pressure of how mark-making possibilities by using different materials (charcoal, pencils, cut paper, black and white acrylic paint) to create harmony that resonates throughout the composition. Great drawings and paintings of the past will be looked at and discussed and the importance of drawing through the ages considered. On occasion students will work from reproductions of master works. There will be assignments and critiques usually toward the end of the session. Class time is reserved for hard work. Class size: 14",

        "description": "Where should a study of theater begin, and how did pre-modern models of theater change, as successive societies revised, rejected, and appropriated the forms that had gone before? This course will investigate selected periods in world theater, beginning with the massive communal festivals of ancient Greece and culminating in the philosophical upheavals of the Enlightenment. Paying close attention to connections between drama, stagecraft, and modes of spectatorship, we will ask how the theater has shored up political power; how the stage has served as a scale model for the known world; and what has been at stake in changing notions of classicism. Through analytical essays, class presentations, and a final performance project, we will cultivate a critical vocabulary for discussing theaters of the past\u2014and discover their often-surprising legacies in modern and contemporary performance.

In this class we will do a close reading of several of Shakespeare\u2019s plays, trying to understand how the information analyzed and then processed through the director\u2019s imagination, aesthetic, social and political views, emotions and dream life manifests in the production. We will also examine (through video, pictures and written descriptions) seminal productions of these plays and discuss how these directors might have read these texts. Although the primary reading will be of the plays themselves, there will be additional readings from texts such asJonathanMiller\u2019s Subsequent Performances, Peter Brook\u2019s The Shifting Point and Evoking (and Forgetting) Shakespeare, Bert O. States\u2019 Great Reckonings in Little Rooms, Jan Kott\u2019s Shakespeare Our Contemporary, Susan Bennett\u2019s Performing Nostalgia: Shifting Shakespeare and the Contemporary Past, and Political Shakespeare edited byJonathanDollimore and Alan Sinfield.

        "department": "theater",
        "description": "Cross-listed: Photography Since the invention of photography, the photograph has always been an unstable document. Caught between then and now, here and there, the photograph slides between presence and absence attesting to a world beyond the present moment. Performance, on the other hand, is often thought of as pure presence \u2013 as an ephemeral medium that resides wholly in its enactment. This class will challenge both of these presumptions, inviting students to explore the history and theory of both performance and photography. Our study will begin with the history of photography, considering questions about the politics of representation and the display of the body. Moving to the 1960s and beyond we will then explore ways in which artist have intervened in this history of photography through performance, focusing on works by Louise Lawler, Dan Graham, Helio Oiticica, Lucy Lippard, Mark Morrisroe and Nan Goldin. We will conclude by looking at a number of contemporary projects that offer up the photograph itself as a performance, often staging powerful revisions of some of our more ingrained cultural assumptions about self and other. At the center of the mediums of both performance and photography lie fundamental uncertainties about the ontology of the body. As such, we will be particularly attuned to queer, feminist, trans, and critical race and ethnicity studies that open up new terrains for the usefulness of photography and performance. Students will give presentations and conduct writing assignments based on readings. We will also develop a collective photography and performance journal, to be presented in a series of conference days at the end of the semester. Class size: 16",

Using A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream as our primary source text we will unpack Shakespeare\u2019s dramatic strategies (such as juxtaposition, comic tropes and conventions, extremity, fantasy) and examine existing adaptations (films, poetry, graphic novels, plays, musicals, television.) We will also create our own contemporary responses to the play in a variety of genres, which we will both write and perform. Admission by application.

China in the 20th century witnessed a history of unprecedented upheavals and radical transformations and its literature in this period was often a battleground for political, cultural, and aesthetic debates. We will read English translations of representative works by major writers from three periods (1918-1949; 1949-1976; since 1976) such as Lu Xun, Ding Ling, Ba Jin, Shen Congwen, Lao She, Mao Dun, and Chang Eileen from the May Fourth Movement and the intellectual radicalization of the first half of the 20th century, and Mo Yan, Yu Hua, Can Xue, and Han Shaogong out of the Cultural Revolution and the liberalization of the post-Mao era. In addition, we will study works by authors from Taiwan and Hong Kong such as Pai Hsien-yung, Wang Wen-hsing, Li Ang, Li Yung-p\u2019ing, Chu T\u2019ien-wen, Xi Xi, and Shi Shu-ching. We will consider issues of language and genre, nationalism and literary tradition, colonialism, women\u2019s emancipation movement, the influence of Western literary modes such as realism and modernism on the inception of literary modernity in China, and the current state of critical approaches to the study of modern Chinese literature.

The struggle to create an imaginative literature by and about Jews is thus examined with respect to often conflicted literary approaches to questions of Jewish identity and history (including persistent anti-Semitism in the countries of the Diaspora and the catastrophe of the Holocaust). In the process we will discuss such notions as Jewish identity and stereotypes, questions of \"apartness\" and \"insideness,\" and explore literary genres such as the novel, the tale, the fable, the folktale and the joke in relation to traditional forms of Jewish storytelling, interpretation and prophecy. We will look as well at what it is that makes \"Jewish humor\" both Jewish and funny and consider the consequences of a particular author's decision to write in either Hebrew or Yiddish, or in a language such as Russian, German or English. We will discuss as well Jewish participation in literary modernism. Authors include Rabbi Nachman of Bratzslav, Isaac Leib Peretz, Sholem Aleichem, Isaac Babel, Franz Kafka, Bruno Schulz, Primo Levi, Isaac Bashevis Singer, Bernard Malamud, Grace Paley, Aharon Appelfeld, Leslie Epstein, and Angel Wagenstein.\" This course is part of the World Literature offering.\nClass size: 22",

In this seminar we will trace some of the Boom's antecedents, particularly in Miguel Cervantes' woeful knight and Jorge Luis Borges' intricate fictional mazes; examine its classics, from Carpentier, Cortazar, Donoso, Fuentes, Garcia Marquez and Vargas Llosa; and delve into the work of some of its irrepressible second generation -- seeking throughout to discover what might account for this brief efflorescence of bold literary experimentation.

        "description": "2 credits It is 2017. Why aren\u2019t there more women in leadership positions? According to a 2014 Pew Research Center report, the majority of American men and women acknowledge the capacity of women to lead. Yet in certain domains\u2014most notably politics and business\u2014women continue to be under-represented at the top. Last year's Presidential race polarized the electorar around constructions of gender in particularly dramatic ways. If we are living in a post-feminist society (as some claim), why do these questions and conflicts continue to arise? Identity is an urgent conversation in 21st-century politics and everyday life, and this includes awareness of how intersectionality shapes gendered experiences. What are the stories that we tell ourselves and each other about equality, representation, privilege, freedom, authority, and success? How do these inflect real-world outcomes for individuals and societies? In this two-credit course we will explore some of the stories that circulate in our culture around women and power, both from an academic and from a practical, real-world perspective. What does it mean to lead? How do we use a language of empowerment? Why has the United States embraced certain narratives of gender equity and success as opposed to those being created in other countries and cultures? We will focus on learning from women who are committed to making a difference in the world through their personal and professional choices, hearing their stories, and reading texts that have been particularly important to them in their lives and work. So too, we will engage with stories from the past (archival research), from across disciplines (the military, higher education, STEM, the arts, media) and from a wide range of perspectives. As an Engaged Liberal Arts and Sciences course, this seminar will provide students with the unique opportunity to bring theory and practice together in a very immediate sense: by the end of the term you will have identified a story only you can tell, whether it is based in political activism, community engagement, or work experience. Drawing on the rich resources here in Annandale as well as through Bard\u2019s other campuses, we will reach out to groups and organizations with a shared focus on gender. Network building is something we will explicitly address. This course is open to all first-year students, but enrollment is limited. Class size: 20",

Throughout, the focus will be on works of \"low brow\" and \"middle brow\" culture that structure the experience of everyday life. Among other topics, we will consider mass entertainment, the emperor system, the student movement and its failure, the birth of environmental awareness, changing dynamics of sex, gender, and family, \"Americanization,\" the mythos of the middle class, and the historical roots of contemporary Japanese society.

Through the reading of both the underground publications of \"samizdat\" and officially published texts of the first period; the post-modernist works written at the end of the twentieth century; and the literary texts of the last two decades, we will focus on the issues of narrative strategies adopted by individual writers, reassessment of Russian history, gender and sexuality, religion and spirituality, cultural and national identity. The course will also explore the changing relationship between Russian literature, the state, and society. Readings include: Venedikt Erofeev, Tatiana Tolstaia, Liudmila Petrushevskaia, Viktor Pelevin, Boris Akunin, The Presniakov Brothers, Ludmila Ulitskaia, Vladimir Sorokin, Andrei Volos, Eugene Vodolazkin, and Mikhail Shishkin.

        "department": "lit2courses",
        "description": "Cross-listed: Human Rights, Middle Eastern Studies Questions of migration, exile, and displacement have been central to the development of the (post)colonial Arabic literary tradition. Tayeb Salih\u2019s Seasons of Migration to the North, widely considered the most important Arabic novel of the last century, charts Mustafa Said\u2019s journey taking him further and further from Sudan, and the frustrations and impossibility of homecoming. While the effects of the expulsions of the 1948 Nakba (catastrophe) and the further displacement of the 1967 Naksa (setback) on the evolution of Arabic prose and poetry are widely recognized, questions surrounding labor, its precarity, and migrations are largely understudied. How for example, does the intersection of a booming oil economy with a displaced and transient workforce, reshape the cultural map of the region? Rather than treat the questions of labor and (forced) migration as separate, in this course we will look at them as intertwined and interdependent. By focusing on Arabic literary production from the second half of the 20th century, we will ask how such works produce a language and aesthetic of displacement and estrangement, one that is able to challenge the hegemony of national boundaries. Finally, we will consider how these literary texts, as well as their authors, travel and migrate to speak to different audiences and from new and shifting centers. Literary texts will be supplemented by theoretical and historical material and will be accompanied by mandatory film screenings. All readings will be in English. This course is part of the Liberal Arts Consortium on Forced Migration, Displacement and Education initiative. Class size: 22",

        "description": "Cross-listed: Environmental & Urban Studies; Russian Emperors, serfs, merchants, and soldiers built St. Petersburg, but it was the writers who put it on the cultural map of the world. Founded on the outskirts of the empire, the city served as a missing link between \"enlightened\" Europe and \"barbaric\" Asia, between the turbulent past of the Western civilization and its uncertain future. Considered to be too cold, too formal, too imperial on the outside, St.   Petersburg harbored revolutionary ideas and terrorist movements that threatened to explode from within. While its granite quays were erected to withstand the assault of the floods, some of its most famous monuments, including literary works, resisted the onset of new, radical ideologies. In this course, we will study the conflicting nature of the city as reflected in literature and literary criticism. The poems and novels on our reading list will provide a sweeping overview of Russia\u2019s literary canon in the 19th and 20th centuries, from Pushkin to Dostoevsky and from Gogol to Bely and Nabokov. After exploring Queen of Spades, Crime and Punishment, and Anna Karenina, we will move on to Petersburg and The Defense, thus undertaking a journey through Russia\u2019s literary tradition and the urban landscape of the north with the authors who either reconstructed St. Petersburg in their memory or re-visited it in their imaginations.",

Its use of melodrama and the macabre often disguise the psychological, sexual, and emotional issues that are in fact more horrifying than the contents of a haunted house. The gothic novel in America has often confronted topics pertinent to American identity and history. In this course we will examine how many American authors used the gothic genre to actually engage with social, political and cultural concerns. We will read novels and short stories that span the 19th and 20th century by authors such as Nathaniel Hawthorne, Edgar Allan Poe,Louisa May Alcott, Henry James, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Harriet Jacobs, Edith Wharton, William Faulkner, Shirley Jackson and James Baldwin.Class size: 18",

The premise of the course is that the new-ness of new media can only be approached against the background of humanistic experimentation and imagination, even as it transforms our lives and experiences. We will examine a range of meanings of the word \"media,\" from journalism and news to entertainment to the Internet and social media. We will read key media theorists (Walter Benjamin, Donna Haraway, Friedrich Kittler, Ariella Azoulay, and Marshall McLuhan), and examine a range of critical, literary, and artistic reflections on our mediated universe. We will also spend some hands-on time working with -- and not just on -- media, in order to assess our own positions not just as as users and consumers but also as producers of media.

And what can this effort to represent injustice, suffering, or resistance tell us about fiction and literature? This course will focus on a wide range of fictions, from a variety of writers with different backgrounds, that tell unusual stories about the rights of individuals and communities to justice. We will read novels addressing human migration, injustices committed in the name of the state against a minority, and the harsh conditions under which some communities operate as part of their survival strategy, among other topics. We will look at the ways in which literary forms can allow universalizing claims to be made, exploring how racism, disenfranchisement, poverty, and lack of access to education and health care, for instance, can affect the dignity of all humans. Readings may include: Chronicles of a Death Foretold by Garcia Marquez; Snow Falling on Cedars by David Guterson; Smilla\u2019s Sense of Snow by Peter Hoeg; Our Nig by Harriet Wilson; Balzac & the Chinese Seamstress by Sijai Dai; Winter is in the Blood by James Welch; The Way to Rainy Mountain by N.

If literary theory rigorously questions things we take to be common sense -- what precisely do we mean when we talk about \"authors\" and \"texts,\" for instance? -- it also provides a space for the critical, creative linking of the literary to the social. How has colonialism shaped our ideas of the novel? What is the relationship between theories of intention and the performance of gender? And how do questions of racial difference intersect with models of narrative voice? We will read works that tackle these issues (and more) by theorists including Walter Benjamin, John Crowe Ransom, Judith Butler,Edward Said, Roland Barthes, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, Gayatri\nSpivak, Aamir Mufti, and Raymond Williams.

The struggle to create an imaginative literature by and about Jews is thus examined with respect to often conflicted literary approaches to questions of Jewish identity and history (including persistent anti-Semitism in the countries of the Diaspora and the catastrophe of the Holocaust). In the process we will discuss such notions as Jewish identity and stereotypes, questions of \"apartness\" and \"insideness,\" and explore literary genres such as the novel, the tale, the fable, the folktale and the joke in relation to traditional forms of Jewish storytelling, interpretation and prophecy. We will look as well at what it is that makes \"Jewish humor\" both Jewish and funny and consider the consequences of a particular author's decision to write in either Hebrew or Yiddish, or in a language such as Russian, German or English. We will discuss as well Jewish participation in literary modernism. Authors include Rabbi Nachman of Bratzslav, Isaac Leib Peretz, Sholem Aleichem, Isaac Babel, Franz Kafka, Bruno Schulz, Primo Levi, Isaac Bashevis Singer, Bernard Malamud, Grace Paley, Aharon Appelfeld, Leslie Epstein, and Angel Wagenstein.\" This course is part of the World Literature offering.

The course will include explorations of women\u2019s writing across genres, representations of and by women in the poetry, fiction, and visual art of the period, and a rigorous interrogation and destabilization of the category of \"woman\" and the \"female body\" as historical and literary figures. Using methodologies drawn from feminist studies, queer studies, and disability studies, this course will ask the fundamental question: how or what does the word \"woman\" mean across the nineteenth- and early twentieth centuries? How might the category be useful or not for evaluating the aesthetic and ethical positions of texts, verbal and visual? And how are bodies relevant in thinking through these questions? Texts might include works by: Charlotte and Emily Bront\u00eb, William Makepeace Thackeray, Harriet Martineau, Coventry Patmore, Robert Browning, the Pre-Raphaelite and Aestheticist painters, photographers, and poets, Michael Field (Katherine Bradley and Edith Cooper), Oscar Wilde, Virginia Woolf, Ford Madox Ford, William Butler Yeats, and Radclyffe Hall.

Tracing the various poetic lineages from the Romantic era to the present moment, we will explore the ways in which conceptions of the power of poetry are transformed by shifting historical, aesthetic, political, and philosophical moments. Throughout our investigations, we will ask: What is the relationship between poetic utterance and political power? What role do subjectivity and emotion play in poetic expression?

We will read \"Details of a Sunset,\" \"Christmas,\" \"A Guide to Berlin,\" \"A Nursery Tale,\" \"The Visit to the Museum,\" \"The Circle,\" \"Spring in Fialta,\" \"Cloud, Castle, Lake,\" \"Ultima Thule,\" \"Solus Rex,\" \"Signs and Symbols,\" and \"The Vane Sisters.\" Keeping our eyes open for the elusive, but meaningful, textual details and discussing the writer\u2019s narrative strategies, we will also trace the metaphysical streak that runs through the entire Nabokov oeuvre. A discussion of all matters editorial will be our priority. We will study Nabokov\u2019s correspondence with Katharine White and William Maxwell, his editors at The New Yorker, and look at the drafts of his stories, now part of the Berg Collection in the NYPL. Our endeavor to understand the Nabokovian process of composition and revision will go hand-in-hand with the work on our own writing. This course is a literature junior seminar.

Students will read one novel per week, occasionally supplemented by theoretical texts. Analytical writing will be the primary mode of response, but a creative option will be given for students to find their own fictive path to a social, ethical or political issue. The syllabus will draw from the following texts: Kleist\u2019s Michael Kohlhaas, Graham Greene\u2019s The Power and the Glory or The Heart of the Matter, Margaret Atwood\u2019s The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, Roberto Bolano\u2019s By Night in Chile, Michel Tournier\u2019s The Ogre, Elfriede Jelinek\u2019s\nWonderful Wonderful Times, J.M.

Eliot famously remarked, \"what happens when a new work of art is created is something that happens simultaneously to all the works of art which preceded it.\" Taking this statement as our starting point, this seminar will explore the perpetual trans-historical dialogue taking place within Anglo-American poetry and poetics. Tracing the various poetic lineages from the Romantic era to the present moment, we will explore the ways in which conceptions of the power of poetry are transformed by shifting historical, aesthetic, political, and philosophical moments. Throughout our investigations, we will ask: What is the relationship between poetic utterance and political power? What role do subjectivity and emotion play in poetic expression? How do the formal dimensions of language complicate its denotative function?

The course will include explorations of women\u2019s writing across genres, representations of and by women in the poetry, fiction, and visual art of the period, and a rigorous interrogation and destabilization of the category of \"woman\" and the \"female body\" as historical and literary figures. Using methodologies drawn from feminist studies, queer studies, and disability studies, this course will ask the fundamental question: how or what does the word \"woman\" mean across the nineteenth- and early twentieth centuries? How might the category be useful or not for evaluating the aesthetic and ethical positions of texts, verbal and visual? And how are bodies relevant in thinking through these questions? Texts might include works by: Charlotte and Emily Bront\u00eb, William Makepeace Thackeray, Harriet Martineau, Coventry Patmore, Robert Browning, the Pre-Raphaelite and Aestheticist painters, photographers, and poets, Michael Field (Katherine Bradley and Edith Cooper), Oscar Wilde, Virginia Woolf, Ford Madox Ford, William Butler Yeats, and Radclyffe Hall.

Famed for its style and its distinctive view of love, sex and cruelty, reading, language and memory, Proust\u2019s modernist epic broke new ground in the invention of a genre that lies between fiction and autobiography. Through a semester devoted to the close reading of Swann\u2019s Way and Time Regained in their entirety and several substantial key-excerpts taken from all the other volumes, we will try to understand the complex nature of Proust\u2019s masterpiece and, among other things, examine the ways in which it accounts for the temporality and new rhythms of modern life. We will also question the narrative and stylistic function of homosexuality, discuss the significance of the massive social disruption brought about by the Great War and investigate why the visual arts and music are seminal to the narration.

In this seminar we will trace some of the Boom's antecedents, particularly in Miguel Cervantes' woeful knight and Jorge Luis Borges' intricate fictional mazes; examine its classics, from Carpentier, Cortazar, Donoso, Fuentes, Garcia Marquez and Vargas Llosa; and delve into the work of some of its irrepressible second generation -- seeking throughout to discover what might account for this brief efflorescence of bold literary experimentation.

        "description": "Cross-listed: American Studies This course is centered around American literary texts produced between (roughly) 1865 and 1914, by a variety of writers seeking to convey the \"realities\" of American life and culture in this turbulent period. A conventional understanding of Realism has, for many years, been defined by the works of James, Howells, Twain, Crane, Dreiser, Wharton, and Chopin---a handful of writers whose influential and significant contributions to the aesthetic movement of Realism are uncontested, but whose positionality (especially as white, privileged, and, for the most part, male) severely limited their ability to record, shape, or criticize the diverse whole of \"real\" American life. Alongside works by these writers, then, we will also examine texts by writers of color, of varying ethnicities, and by greater numbers of women, in order to access and better understand the different realities they were striving to document and influence. Texts by Zitkala-Sa, Charles Chesnutt, W.E.B. DuBois, James Weldon Johnson, and Sui Sin Far---whose contributions are now, finally, garnering attention as responsive to and constitutive of a larger Realist aesthetic---flesh out our shared reading list, enriching and complicating our encounters with American languages, stories, and forms. In addition to the course readings, students will work closely with essays in contemporary criticism to analyze how current scholars wrangle with problems of defining Realism and its offshoots, among them Naturalism and Regionalism. A variety of writing assignments will afford us the opportunity to consider how small groups of texts converse about Realism\u2019s major themes and preoccupations.

China in the 20th century witnessed a history of unprecedented upheavals and radical transformations and its literature in this period was often a battleground for political, cultural, and aesthetic debates. We will read English translations of representative works by major writers from three periods (1918-1949; 1949-1976; since 1976) such as Lu Xun, Ding Ling, Ba Jin, Shen Congwen, Lao She, Mao Dun, and Chang Eileen from the May Fourth Movement and the intellectual radicalization of the first half of the 20th century, and Mo Yan, Yu Hua, Can Xue, and Han Shaogong out of the Cultural Revolution and the liberalization of the post-Mao era. In addition, we will study works by authors from Taiwan and Hong Kong such as Pai Hsien-yung, Wang Wen-hsing, Li Ang, Li Yung-ping, Chu Tien-wen, Xi Xi, and Shi Shu-ching. We will consider issues of language and genre, nationalism and literary tradition, colonialism, womens emancipation movement, the influence of Western literary modes such as realism and modernism on the inception of literary modernity in China, and the current state of critical approaches to the study of modern Chinese literature.

Ancient sources such as vase paintings, inscriptions, and texts like Aeschylus Persians and Aristophanes comedies will allow us to view the Greek world both from the top down and from the bottom up, asking how the experience of statesmen and literary authors as well as soldiers, merchants, women, and slaves shaped and was shaped by the world of Greece.

The first time round we will read it in three weeks, in Robert Fitzgeralds extraordinarily noble 1983 translation, the last work of perhaps the finest 20th century translator of ancient Greek and Latin poetry. After a six-week break we will reread the Aeneid in the just-published translation of perhaps the finest 21st century translator of Latin poetry, David Ferry, who, at 94, has accepted Bards invitation to come read his translation in its month of publication, October 2017. In the six weeks between our reading and rereading of the Aeneid we will study intensely the historical background of the poems compositiona century of devastating civil war, which ended with the fateful conversion of Romes republican government to a system of one-man rule that would last for centuries. And we will also read, in this six-week break, Vergils earlier works, the Eclogues and the Georgics, plus Greek poems which were the models he adopted and transformed: Theocritus Idylls, Hesiods Works and Days, and key books of the Iliad and the Odyssey.

Although we will read several texts commonly included in the canon of the Querelle, this course is not meant to be a survey of this specific historical conflict, but rather a broader exploration of the roles played by the past, the present and the future in the creation and reception of works of literature in the French tradition. We will focus on several authorial oppositions (Corneille/Racine, Voltaire/Rousseau, Balzac/Flaubert, Sartre/Blanchot), oppositions which each time restate the place of literature on the temporal spectrum. Readings from Montaigne, Corneille, De Scud\u00e9ry, De S\u00e9vign\u00e9, Racine, Boileau, La Fontaine, Perrault, Cr\u00e9billon fils, Voltaire, Diderot, Rousseau, De Sta\u00ebl, Constant, Balzac, Flaubert, Zola, Huysmans, Sartre and Blanchot.

Does a certain kind of exploration of madness offer a way to think about the mass appeal of nationalism or fascism?

As we consider these and similar questions, authors whose works will spur discussion include Kafka (The Judgment and Diaries), Goethe (Faust I), Freud (The Wolf-Man), Breton (Nadja), H\u00f6lderlin (selected poems), Rimbaud (The Drunken Boat), Kleist (St. Cecilia, or the Power of Music), Foucault (History of Madness), Beckett (Murphy), Celan (selected poems and prose writings), and Sebald (The Emigrants); films we will study include those by Visconti and Herzog. Students will become familiar with key texts from the German and also English and French traditions from around 1800 to the late 20th century, while honing their interpretive skills as readers and critics. We will consider the concept of madness from formal, philosophical, political, and ethical perspectives. All readings and discussions in English. Class size: 22",

After an overview of pivotal moments in the history and poetics of German theater (Lessing, Schiller, Hauptmann), students will engage in analyzing specific developments in modern and contemporary theater. Among others, we will explore the new aesthetics of expressionist theater and Max Reinhardt\u2019s work at the Deutsche Theater, Bertolt Brecht\u2019s development of the Epic Theater before and during World War II, post-war efforts to stage Vergangenheitbew\u00e4ltigung (\"coming to terms with the past\" of the Third Reich and the Holocaust), e.g., with politically engaged documentary pieces, up to the voicing of contemporary and multicultural experiences in re-unified Germany not only on but also off theater stages, thereby calling into question traditional ways of viewing as well as the role of the institution theater in Germany today. \u2013Readings include full texts or excerpts from: Frank Wedekind, Spring Awakening (1895/1906); Bertolt Brecht, Mother Courage and Her ,Children (1939); Wolfgang Borchert, The Man Outside (1947); Peter Weiss.

        "department": "german",
        "description": "\"One alone is always wrong; but with two involved, the truth begins,\" reads an aphorism by Friedrich Nietzsche. His criticism of the isolated genius thinker also proposes an alternative mode of thinking and writing: creative collaboration. The seminar will explore several instances of such creative collaborations, e.g. Friedrich Nietzsche and Lou Andreas Salome, the latter and Rainer Maria Rilke, Hannah Arendt and several poet friends of different languages, Paul Celan and Ingeborg Bachmann, Oskar Pastior and Nobel Prize Winner Herta M\u00fcller. These intellectual relationships are also documented in letter exchanges, so that our seminar will unfold the word \"correspondence\" in a literal and in a figurative way. In this sense, \"Correspondence\" exceeds the limits of a single literary text or a letter; its dynamics translates into poems, novels, essays, or theoretical writings. As a consequence, fundamental categories such as authorship, work, intertextuality, or addressing are called into question. Our seminar will continuously reflect upon those terms based on canonical writings of modern literary criticism, including Benjamin, and (to be read in English) Genette, Barthes, L\u00e9vinas, Derrida.

The heterogeneous aspects of the Italian cultural field after WWII are considered in a wide-ranging framework, in which postwar histories are informed not simply by the external context of the Cold War but also by preceding wartime discourses. The course encompasses the ideological debate of the late 1940s, the role of aesthetics in reshaping the national self (Neorealism and its discontents), and the politics of memory enacted by literature and film (Italo Calvino, Curzio Malaparte, Carlo Levi). It also investigates the legacy of violence left by Fascism and the war, the trauma of national defeat, and Italian responsibility in WWII and the Holocaust (Primo Levi, Rosetta Loy). Finally, it surveys the persistence of gender and racial exclusions after the establishment of a new democracy. Prerequisites: Italian 202 or permission of instructor. Conducted in Italian. ",

Founded on the outskirts of the empire, the city served as a missing link between \"enlightened\" Europe and \"barbaric\" Asia, between the turbulent past of the Western civilization and its uncertain future. Considered to be too cold, too formal, too imperial on the outside, St. Petersburg harbored revolutionary ideas and terrorist movements that threatened to explode from within. While its granite quays were erected to withstand the assault of the floods, some of its most famous monuments, including literary works, resisted the onset of new, radical ideologies. In this course, we will study the conflicting nature of the city as reflected in literature and literary criticism. The poems and novels on our reading list will provide a sweeping overview of Russia\u2019s literary canon in the 19th and 20th centuries, from Pushkin to Dostoevsky and from Gogol to Bely and Nabokov. After exploring Queen of Spades, Crime and Punishment, and Anna Karenina, we will move on to Petersburg and The Defense, thus undertaking a journey through Russia\u2019s literary tradition and the urban landscape of the north with the authors who either reconstructed St. Petersburg in their memory or re-visited it in their imaginations.",

        "description": "Federico Garcia Lorca is Spain\u2019s most well-known and widely read poet and playwright of the 20th Century. It is perhaps in part due to this well-deserved fame that he has traditionally been considered as the quintessential Spanish contemporary writer. His works are virtually untranslatable and hermetically personal, and yet continue to draw the spellbound interest of a loyal readership all around the globe. In this course we will study Lorca\u2019s poetry and drama closely \u2013 from his early classicist texts to his late avant-garde production, including his famous folklorist Gipsy Ballads, his surrealist Poet in New York, and plays like Blood Wedding or The House of Bernarda Alba. We will do so in the context of Spain\u2019s cultural and political life, in the years leading up to Lorca\u2019s assassination during the early days of the Spanish Civil War (1936-39) as well as in the posthumous context of his afterlives. We will pay particular attention to how the reception of his eventful life and his writing, both in Spain and abroad, has contributed to build the monumental figure of a national poet and even a martyr. Throughout the course, we will also lend an equally attentive ear to those traits that seem foreign, strange and discordant in this well-rounded figure, with the idea of reaching a better understanding of the tragic element that may still propel Lorca\u2019s ghostly afterlife beyond the narrow boundaries of the Spanish historical context.

We will explore the effects of climate change on the ecology of animals, plants, and microbes, including biodiversity and ecosystem function, but will also include discussion on how these biologically oriented questions relate to the interconnected issues of human society, politics, and the economy. In addition, we will focus on relevant physical topics including the astronomical basis for natural variation in climate (years to eons), basics of global weather (e.g. gyres and Hadley cells), glacial cycles and marine circulation. In the laboratory portion of the course students will analyze ice core data, and use a bevy of tools to predict changes in the timing of migration in birds and butterflies, and predict how climate change will affect the distribution and range of plant and animal species.

Students will learn methods that are appropriate for different types of data. Topics covered include elementary probability and statistics, characteristics of frequency distributions, hypothesis testing, contingency tests, correlation and regression analysis, different ways to compare means, nonparametric tests, and an introduction to multivariate tests. This course is intended for sophomore and junior biology majors, although it is open to students of all years. One objective of the course is to provide biology majors the statistical background they need to analyze data for their own senior research; biology students should take this course before their senior year, if possible. Notice, though, that the topics in this course are applicable to many advanced courses.

How do anthropogenic actions such as antibiotic pollution affect key microbial populations found in soil, waterways, and hosts? This research intensive course uses metagenomics, a set of methodologies combining next-generation sequencing and computational biology, to study microbial communities as a whole. More specifically, students will learn how to use advanced bioinformatics tools to analyze and vizualize large data sets generated by DNA sequencing. Students will also use multivariate statistics to characterize changes in microbial diverstiy resulting from differences in selective environments. As a final project, students will be responsible to design and conduct their own metagenomics study using a system of their own choice. For example, students will be able to study the effect of antibiotic pollution on the microbiome of an animal hosts or to study the effect of salt concentration on food fermentation. The course format aim to create an immersive research experience where students will study the applications of bioinformatic tools to important public health issues, while taking an active role in an ongoing research program.

Successful conservation ventures still require notable expertise in ecological, evolutionary and behavioral sciences, but need to integrate economic, psychological, sociological and political considerations in order to be successful. This course will focus entirely on case studies in the conservation of plant and animal species, and even entire ecosystems, to explore the interplay and relative importance of these different disciplines in the success or failure of conservation ventures. This primarily discussion-based class will focus on the review and discussion of readings and other documentation of modern topics in conservation in the United States, Central America, Africa and mainland China. Discussion and writing assignments will focus on conservation science as a central pillar, with the goal of understanding how that science and its implementation and prioritization must respond to the constraints and opportunities associated with politics, religion, local livelihoods and even the need to militarize conservation efforts.

These infectious diseases can be defined as a type of \"wicked problem,\" in which no clear solution exists, due to their complexity. To manage this increase in infectious disease cases, current biotechnological advances can be used to design more effective methods for detecting, treating and preventing infectious diseases. These new methods often are possible to deploy in areas at a lower cost, or in locations where resources may be limited. This class will examine primary literature and review papers to learn about all angles of infectious disease management. This includes, but is not limited to: development of assays for low- level detection, application of nanosized agents for drug delivery, and design of novel vaccines for emerging infectious diseases, including Ebola, Zika, SARS, and cholera.

We will start with a survey of the most compelling lines of evidence for climate change, how they are obtained/derived and some of their limitations. We will then discuss in some depth idealized one-dimensional planetary radiative and thermal balance, first in the absence of an atmosphere, and then in the presence of a radiatively active one, with variable number of layers. In this context, it will become interesting to explore atmospheric opacity with respect to various radiative types, and what natural and anthropogenic effects affect this opacity. A related topic will be natural feedbacks, such as water vapor and could feedbacks. We will next place current (modern) observations of climate change in the broader context of past climates, emphasizing the last couple millennia,hundreds of millennia, and finally the ten million-year scale geological record. We will conclude the course with some discussion about the objective of successful policy mitigation efforts, and their implementation obstacles. While not technical per se, participation in this course does require the ability to solve a couple of linear algebraic equations (like solving x + 4 = 2y and 2x - 3y = 6 for x and y) and to perform some very basic manipulation of data and plot the results (using, e.g., Microsoft's Excel).

Our ethnographic gaze will be turned inward as well as outward. We will therefore consider the reasons behind, and ramifications of, anthropology\u2019s self-reflexive turn in and around the 1980s.

We ask how artifacts of mundane daily life and ritual materials were left in juxtaposition. At the Forest site, toward the Hudson River along an old carriage path behind Admissions, chipped stone objects afford the most conspicuous evidence of activity 5,000 years ago. Our focus, however, will be on the distribution of fragmentary ceramic vessels and whether they were made from clay found beneath a nearby waterfall. From the soil of fire pits on the adjacent promontory may emerge vestiges of plants and animals with which people interacted. Basic excavation techniques combine with microscopy and cartographic analyses to situate our discoveries in the living space. Our interpretive perspectives range in scale from miniscule wear patterns to the central Hudson Valley and beyond, to the ancient coastal Northeast. We will perform replicative experiments to make and use stone tools. Weekly writings on various studies will receive discussion in seminar. By interview with professor. Another way to prepare for this course is the Field School this summer that likely will encounter ancient artifacts through similar techniques of excavation and contextualization; for info, go to http://www.bard.edu/archaeology.

This course begins with an investigation of the Anthropocene\u2019s theoretical origins, and how this framework reorients our basic assumptions in relation to nature and the physical world. How are the effects and implications of the Anthropocene calculated and interpreted in public discourse and policy? How has the idea given rise to alternative theories, such as the Capitalocene or Chthulucene, to complicate its original premise? Should we seek to preserve earth\u2019s systems in their \u2018natural state,\u2019 or embrace the idea of actively managing socio-natural landscapes? To explore these questions, we will turn to case studies based in Asia, a region assumed to hold much of the world\u2019s environmental future in its hands. By looking at how communities, movements, states, and institutions articulate new moral and political imperatives in response to the crisis, we will consider the Anthropocene as a productive force that entails a playful reimagining and remaking of human engagements with the environment. Specific topics will include green building and greenhouse gas emission reduction in South Korea, urban agriculture and post-3.11 food movements in Japan, giant panda conservation and changing meanings of wildlife in China, and wind farms and alternative energy in the Philippines.

Why do groups (e.g. queer, indigenous, religious, ethnic) seek recognition from this thing we call the state while at the same time mocking, being suspicious or fearful of it? Like many groups, scholarship about the modern state tends to be shot through with \"state phobia.\" However, the most recent elections in the United States are challenging suspicions of the state as a set of institutions among many of the regime's critics. Anthropological analysis of the state could not be more urgent. The first half of this course explores how scholars define the modern state and how they critique its effects on societies and cultures in the twentieth century. We begin with foundational theories of the state (e.g. Weber, Hall, Althusser, Foucault, and Bourdieu). Due to his major influence on anthropological work on neoliberalism, immigration, bureaucracy, state healthcare and social welfare, we place special emphasis on how Michel Foucault conceptualized the modern state and his critique of its attendant modes of power (e.g. discipline, governmentality, biopolitics). During the second half of the course we read ethnographies of the state in the United States, Indonesia, Australia, Canada, Togo, Gaza, France, Cameroon, India, Egypt, Turkey and Germany. We investigate the unlikely relationships between phenomena such as corruption, borders, railroads, time, insanity, sexuality, warrior honeybees and science, on the one hand, and the effects, and meanings, of statehood and state-making in the modern world, on the other. How do institutions, practices and people come to appear like a state in the first place? We conclude with an examination of a question inspired by the recent political mobilizations of the Black Lives Matter movement in the United States. In what ways does it make sense -and in what ways does it not-to call the U.S. a \"police state\"? Class size: 22",

This course begins with the assumption that language and culture are inseparable, and will introduce students to theoretical and ethnographic approaches that demonstrate this connection in different ways. The course will include close analysis of everyday conversations as well as social analysis of broader discourses related to class, gender, and nationality in written and oral narratives. Some of the topics we will discuss include: how authority is established through specific forms of speech, the performative power of language, the relationship between language and social hierarchies, the study of discourse as historical and social forms. We will also examine the way technology and technological metaphors in language have been fundamental in shaping the way different cultures perceive their social worlds. Students will be required to do their own cultural analysis of a conversation, a written or oral narrative, and discourse on the web or other media using the conceptual tools we develop through the course.

        "department": "anthropology",
        "description": "Cross-listed: Human Rights Since 2015, more than two million people from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and other countries have travelled to Europe, typically without state authorization, to seek asylum and refuge. This course examines the arrival of these refugees and the varied ways their presence has come to be viewed as a \"crisis.\" Drawing on recent ethnographic research and anthropological theorizing, we shall consider the discourses and practices that shape how people in the Middle East and Africa seek to cross European borders. We shall investigate the innovations in surveillance, security, and bureaucratic management that the EU and its member states have employed to prevent and regulate refugees' entry. We shall explore the techniques with which state agencies have sought both to govern and to care for refugees after their arrival in European nation-states. And we shall critically engage with the populist rhetoric and violence that have targeted refugees as threats to national and European integrity. Throughout the course, our readings and discussions will reflect on the epistemology and politics of \"crisis.\" Is the declaration of a crisis a neutral act that announces a break from \"the normal\" in a self-evident, objective way? Or is it instead an ideologically charged claim that varied actors may employ to mobilize public fears, desires, and resentments and to promote particular visions of the nation, citizenship, and state obligation?

How are systems of thought, symbolic forms, and ritual practice formulated and expressed across time and space? What are the distinctive methods of structural functionalism, processual analysis, interpretive anthropology, and political economy for the study of religious systems? Our primary focus will be on non-Western conceptual systems and religions, and will include \"primitive rationality,\" the interpretation of myth, magic and systems of classification (such as totem and taboo), and the analysis of ritual and religious practice and practitioners, to include witchcraft, rites of passage, spirit possession, and prophetic and revitalization movements. In particular, we will study power and resistance, the rhetoric of persuasion, political spectacle and charisma, and religious fundamentalism and their expressions in the contemporary world. Readings will draw from theorists such as Durkheim, L\u00e9vi-Strauss, Douglas, Turner, and Geertz among other classical and contemporary theorists. Our primary focus is on the religions and syncretistic religious expressions in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific, as well as on local variants of world traditions such as Christianity.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Environmental & Urban Studies; Middle Eastern Studies; Science, Technology, Society \"Culture\" has long been a key explanatory framework for scholars studying the modern Middle East. It has also been critical to the sorting, surveiling, managing and mobilizing techniques used by colonial and post-colonial regimes. Meanwhile nature, culture\u2019s doppleganger, has been quietly at work \"purifying\" the category of \"culture\" from the objects and processes assumed to be external to it. This course brings \"nature\" out of culture\u2019s shadows in order to examine how ideas about nature and the natural have shaped social scientific and historical scholarship on, and political and cultural formations within, the modern Middle  East. We will investigate the relationship between nature and power in contexts of empire, decolonization and postcoloniality. Under the broad term \"nature\" we will consider such diverse topics as kinship, nationalism, violence, technology, war, race, gender, sexuality, environmentalism, fossil fuels and genetics. What role do genetics play in twenty-first century Middle East politics? How have practices of \"taming\" and managing nature and its resources shaped the parameters within which political authority\u2014and revolution\u2014can emerge? What can the study of the Middle East tell us about the extent to which homosexuality is a biological universal? What are the tensions between the idea of competing \"environmental imaginaries\" and theories that the nonhuman environment (e.g. rivers, dams, mosquitoes) has helped determine political, social and economic outcomes in the Middle East?

Photographs of two-headed Iraqi babies circulate with captions about their mothers' exposure to unidentified toxic chemicals following the U.S. led invasion of Iraq. Widespread calls to close Indian Point Nuclear facility, 1.5 hours south of Bard, by 2021, remind us that we live exposed to nuclear leakage, usually without knowing it. These moments raise questions about the production of expert knowledge and the forms of evidence that count in claims-making about exposure to toxic materials. Toxicity and contamination are generally thought of as corrosive, damaging and destructive of human health and natural environments. But they are also generative. This seminar investigates what they make possible-and thinkable-by exploring controversies around exposure to toxicity and contamination from Hiroshima to Flint. We will begin by reading about nineteenth and early twentieth century American and European ideas about contamination \"at home\" and in the colonies. The course will then consider ethnographic case studies from Japan, the United States, Ukraine, Iraq, Palestine and India. Discussions will consider questions including: How do knowledge about toxicity and distributed risks of contamination transform cultural life? What is the relationship between environments, bodies and bodies of knowledge? How are the boundaries of the self, of communities and ideas about ethics, rights and duties renegotiated through adjudication of exposure? How have nuclear disasters changed the meanings of biological risk, biosecurity and governmental uncertainty? What is the relationship between toxicity and political authority? What forms of agency (human and non-human) emerge and conflict around contamination controversies? When contamination is invisible to the naked eye and undetectable by other senses, how is it made perceptible and what new forms of epistemology does that engender? What are the different temporalities of contamination and how do they contribute to a politics of uncertainty? How are certain spaces-whole cities, regions, workplaces, infrastructures-produced as toxic and dangerous? Class size: 15",

Required of all anthropology majors, this course will also be of interest to students wishing to explore critical innovations in the study of local, national, and mass culture around the world. In contrast to early anthropological focus on seemingly isolated, holistic cultures, more recent studies have turned their attention to contest within societies and the intersection of local systems of meaning with global processes of politics, economics and history. The class will be designed around an influential social theorist, such as Bourdieu, Bakhtin, or Marx, and the application of their theories by anthropologists, such as Aihwa Ong, Judith Irvine, or Michael Taussig. The seminar will involve participation from all of the faculty in the anthropology department. It aims to inspire critical engagement with an eye towards developing theoretical tools and questions for a senior project that makes use of contemporary theories of culture.

We will cover theories of the production, supply and demand for health and health care services with special emphasis on the theoretical implications for policy, particularly in the United States. We will approach the determinants and policy implications of health and health care services through neoclassical as well as heterodox schools of economic thought. As such, students will develop an understanding of the politics, social context and production of health and well-being. The course endeavors not to provide students with a set of 'facts' regarding systems of health provisioning in different contexts. Rather, the course will equip students with the analytical tools necessary for continued intellectual engagement in research and debates surrounding the economics of health. Students will study competing perspectives on the ability of markets to efficiently provision health care services. Further, we will cover economic theories related to health, such as the economics of information, in addition to institutional approaches that highlight the role of history and politics. As such, we will pay special attention to the historical development of health care services in the U.S. to provide an institutional account of the economic, historical and political aspects involved with the current health services market. The course will pay special emphasis to the application of the analytical tools developed in class to current trends and debates in the U.S. For example, we will critically investigate the widespread use of cost-benefit analysis in the implementation of federal rules and policies addressing public health. We will also discuss trends in healthcare expenditures, cost control mechanisms, healthcare reform proposals as well as issues of equity and ethics in access to (and delivery of) health care.

We begin in the nineteenth century when European contact had initiated a process of dramatic change throughout the continent; Japan began a process of unprecedented modernization, China confronted a series of internal conflicts and external threats, and much of the rest of the continent was absorbed directly into the colonial economy. We then compare the trajectories of economic change during the twentieth century. Particular attention is paid to the various economic models pursued in the region, including the colonial export economy of Southeast Asia, export-oriented industrialization in Japan, South Korea and Southeast Asia, import-substituting industrialization in India, and the communist economy of Mao\u2019s China and mainland Southeast Asia. The regions covered are East Asia, Southeast Asia and South Asia. Prerequisite: Econ 100 or prior coursework in Asian Studies. Class size: 22",

This course provides an introduction to economic theories and concepts that help us understand why nations trade, who benefits and who loses from trade, and why trade is regulated. Each week, we will pose a question based on an issue of current interest (e.g. Does free trade contribute to widening the gap between the rich and the poor? Why does the US import Chevy cars from Canada? Should the US ban clothing imports from sweatshops in Bangladesh? Should Apple move the production of iPads from China to the US? Did NAFTA contribute to an increase in illegal immigration?) and develop theoretical tools that help us answer it. Theories will be drawn from a variety of perspectives and the analysis will be grounded in the historical and political context of each policy issue. Prerequisite: Econ 100. Class size: 22",

Economic theory helps us to develop behavioral hypotheses, while statistics help us to test these hypotheses. For example, consumer theory tells us that there is an inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded; we use econometrics to see if consumers actually behave in this way. Designed as an advanced continuation of Econ 229 (Introduction to Econometrics), this course provides a rigorous treatment of regression analysis. Topics include models and tests that deal with violations of classical assumptions, time series, panel data, structural models and limited dependent variables. In several research projects and assignments, students will use the econometric software STATA to analyze real world data. Prerequisite: Calculus I and Economics 229 or permission of instructor.

More and more income goes to capital-owners and profits, not workers and labor, and since 2000, 95% of income gains have gone to the top 1%. There is much uncertainty regarding the causes and consequences of those trends, and the potential economic policies required. What explains this shift in the distribution of income? What are the roles of technology, international trade, finance, institutions and governance? Why has growth become so biased towards the very few? Is there a tradeoff between growth and equity? Through what processes is income created and distributed? What are extractive and predatory governments? Is inequality bad and if so, why? Is there such a thing as a balanced, or equitable growth and if so, what does it take? This course surveys landmark theories of economic growth and income distribution and is research-based through the reading of state-of-the-art journal articles and the writing of a term paper. A substantial component of the course involves data procurement and analysis and in-class work on laptops. We focus on the United States and provide international comparisons.

After her death, her successors continued this task. Additionally, the creation and development of Montgomery Place mirrored contemporary social relations and cultural conventions, along with shifts in these realities at the national level. As it was populated by indentured servants, tenants, slaves, free workers, and elites, Montgomery Place will be approached as a historical laboratory for understanding social hierarchies, social roles, cultural practices, and the evolving visions of the nation and \"place\" that both sustained and challenged these things during the nineteenth century in the United States.

Yet the reality of American history belies this myth. The nation\u2019s history is transnational and yet we focus mostly on its Anglophone roots, ignoring that the \"U.S.\" was carved out of the contests of many empires and grew on internationally based forced labor regimes. It is a story of individuals, alone and/or together, contesting, reacting towards, rejecting, influencing, and embracing the changing notions of what \"the United States\" and \"America\" were from the sixteenth century well into the nineteenth century. The course focuses on six moments that definitively challenged and shaped conceptions of \"American identity\", \"citizen\", and \"the United   States\": the early colonial period, the Constitutional Convention, Cherokee Removal, the era of the internal slave trade and the \"Market Revolution\", the Mexican-American War, and Reconstruction.

The course covers major topics in Ottoman history, including the empire\u2019s origins, its Islamic and European identities, everyday life under the Ottomans, inter-communal relations, the challenge of separatist movements (Balkan, Greek, Arab) and the emergence of modern Turkish nationalism.

In turn, the image and its archiving were critical facets of the continent\u2019s histories of liberation and post-independence. This survey introduces students to the historical development of photography in Africa and the historical uses of photographs in the late-nineteenth century to recent times. Divided into five parts, the course begins with different theoretical views on the relationship between photography and history. After a consideration of the photography of the royal courts in North Africa and Christian missionaries in West Africa, the class will shift to the role of photography in the making of independent African nations and their liberation struggles during and after World War II. The course concludes by considering the commodization of African photography at international biennales and its functions for single-party regimes that continue to rule across Sub-Saharan Africa. Key themes include photography\u2019s role in shaping historical knowledge and the representation of Africa and its peoples, the appropriation of image making into African creative practices and daily life, the politics of exhibition and archiving, and the ethics of seeing war and social justice. Students will design a historical photography exhibition, and, over the course of the semester, they will also have the opportunity to interact with leading photography curators, photojournalists and art photographers who have spent time in Africa.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Global & International Studies; Historical Studies; Russian Studies Eastern Europe was the largest and most vibrant center of Jewish life for almost five hundred years prior to the Holocaust. In that period East European Jewry underwent a wrenching process of modernization, creating radically new forms of community, culture, and political organization that still shape Jewish life today in the United States and Israel. We will consider topics including the rise of Hasidism and Haskalah (Enlightenment), modern Jewish political movements including Zionism, pogroms and Russian government policy towards the Jews, and the development of modern Jewish literature in Yiddish and Hebrew. Course materials will include primary and secondary historical sources as well as literature. The course will also incorporate guest lectures by faculty at Bard partners in Eastern and Central Europe. Class size: 18",

In addition to the recognized reform movements of the period, we will also challenge ourselves to view other contemporary developments--e.g., the rise of educative exhibits and exhibitionism, racial accommodationism,--as reflections of Progressive thought.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Middle Eastern Studies Capitalism is not only a Western economic system. It is a more comprehensive mode of organizing society that is being continuously adopted, modified and subverted around the globe. In this course, we will explore the multiple, and often counter-intuitive ways, in which capitalism became entrenched in the modern Middle East. Drawing on social, intellectual, environmental and business histories, we will examine how the encounter with modern capitalism shaped such pervasive political phenomena as European imperialism, post-colonial nationalism, and contemporary sectarianism. Additionally, we will dissect common modern practices, like smuggling and consumerism, to uncover how they came to define the culture of capitalism in Middle East over the past two centuries. Finally, we will consider the paradoxical place of the Middle East within the current global (capitalist) order, being at once a major exporter of oil and financial capital that power the world's most advanced economies, and a major exporter of economic migrants and refugees.

        "description": "Cross-listed: American Studies; Human Rights; Latin American Studies The Border. The Ban. The Wall. Raids. Deportations. Separation of Families. Immigrant Rights. Sanctuary. Refugee Resettlement. These words - usually confined to policy, enforcement, and activism related to migrants and refugees - have recently exploded into the public view and entered into constant use. The current political administration made migratory and refugee enforcement, and of migration more generally, a centerpiece of its electoral campaign and the subject of its first executive orders, generating broad public controversy. Most migration to the US is from Latin America, by far the largest single migrant population is from Mexico, and the rise of Central American migration has proved enduring. Focusing on south-north migration from these Latin American regions, this class argues that it is impossible to understand the current political situation in the US without studying the relatively lesser-known history of migrant and refugee human rights over the last three decades, including massive protests, movements for sanctuary, and attempts at reform and enforcement. The class takes into account shifting global demographics, changing reasons for migration, rapid legal and political changes, complex enforcement policies and practices, and powerful community movements for reform, which are often forgotten with the opening and closing of a given news cycle. The class also argues that migrant and refugee voices matter and are critical to understanding migration as an historical and current problem. The course includes migrant, refugee, and activist narratives, and an array of historical, legal, political, and other primary sources. Its goal is to create a more complete historical understanding of Latin American-origin migration in the contemporary US context. This course is part of the Liberal Arts Consortium on Forced Migration, Displacement and Education initiative. Class size: 22",

Our point of departure will be traditional areas of focus for scholars of gender and sexuality in China: footbinding, the cloistering of women, and the masculinization of public space; the transformations of Confucian age-sex hierarchies within the family; the women\u2019s rights movements of the early twentieth century; and the Chinese Communist revolution\u2019s ambivalent legacy for women in the People\u2019s Republic of China. By drawing on recent historical and anthropological literature, we will also analyze gender\u2019s functions in many other aspects of modern Chinese life. These topics will include constructions of masculinity and male identity during China\u2019s late imperial period (1368-1911), the role of gender categories in constructions of Han Chinese relations with both Inner Asian nomadic peoples and Euro-American imperialists, the gendering of citizenship and comradeship in twentieth century China, the impact of global capitalism on gender constructions and sexual relations in contemporary China, and the relation of China\u2019s women\u2019s movement to recent trends in Euro-American feminism and gender studies.

Abenakis watch the snow accumulate around the walls of an English fort, then scale over the defenses silently in the night to attack. En route to find the \"Lost City of Gold,\" Spanish soldiers sack Acoma Pueblo and then flee. \"Coromantees\" and Irish servants challenge English slaveholders' dominion in Barbados and nearly succeed. Colonial America existed in a constant state of war. This course is a close study of formal and informal military conflicts from the 16th to the early 19th centuries, looking at well-known engagements such as the so-called \"French and Indian War\" and lesser known episodes, like the French and Abenaki raid on Deerfield in 1704. Students will learn how European and indigenous American rules of violence developed, shifted, and adapted in response to the Columbian Exchange, and how war came to shape contemporary American identity. In addition to primary sources, we will consider literary, cinematic, and live reenactment interpretations of colonial conflicts and consider what these tell us about the relationships of history and memory.

Through a mix of theoretical and historical texts, we will consider how print media have fostered the development of new political communities like the nation state, generated publics and counter-publics, both created and undermined cultural authority, enabled new dynamics of knowledge production, and facilitated development of new modes of reading and interiority. Our inquiry will be global in scope, encompassing not only the Gutenberg revolution in Europe but also the diverse forms of print culture and print capitalism that developed contemporaneously in the Middle East, South Asia, and East  Asia. Analysis of the recent rise of digital media will provide critical perspective for understanding how the materiality of the printed text and its circulation through space has affected its social, cultural, and political significance. Ten weeks of the course will be dedicated to shared readings and discussion. The remainder of the semester will focus on completion of individual research projects related to the core themes of the course. History concentrators can use this course as a major conference; upper-college students from all concentration areas are welcome. Class size: 15",

Historians are perplexed because Africa\u2019s independence and decolonization were supposed to bring peace and prosperity, and henceforth scholarship reflected this desire and promise. This seminar challenges students to move beyond the rhetoric of political conflict in Africa that extends from realities of failed states and underdevelopment and instead understand these current struggles as crises of historiography. In short, what does a contemporary history of Africa look like with the concept of civil war? Course participants will seek to understand the ongoing conflict in Central  African Republic and South Sudan within a larger historical context of civil war in post-independent Africa. Through shared readings and discussions, students will use primary and secondary sources to consider possible causes for civil unrest in Nigeria, Angola, Mozambique, and Sierra Leone, the actors and interests involved, proposed resolutions, and their immediate and long-term effects. By tracing a historiography of civil war in African historical and political discourse and by analyzing possible methodological complications, students will grapple with how real world experiences and acts of violence translate into historical narratives, the very politics of historical revisionism. Students will be required to develop and carry out an independent research project of their choosing. Class size: 15",

After brief consideration of the origins of history as a formal academic discipline in the 19th Century, and of the transition from political to social history in the mid-twentieth century, we also consider the shift from social history to the multiplicity of approaches that came out of the \"theory explosion\" between the 1960s and early 2000s. This course draws from the fields of modern European, African, and World History. Course readings shall consist mostly (but not entirely) of historical writing about the Great War from a variety of historiographical points of view. Readings also include a wide range of primary materials. Conventional teaching on WWI tends to follow the diplomatic history approach, and to emphasize the war on the western front. To enlarge this view, we will read not only from the classic \"causes of WWI\" literature, but also from gender, cultural, and post\u00ad colonial treatments of the war, and read about the impact of the war on the eastern front, on China, in Africa. Working with this diversity of texts gives us the opportunity explicitly to discuss how different historiographical approaches change how we understand \"what happened.\" This course satisfies the historiography requirement for Historical Studies concentrators; it may also serve as a Major Conference if arranged with the instructor.

What are human rights and what is their source? What is the relationship between human rights and human nature, human rights and morality, human rights and law, human rights and freedom? Can any human right truly be universal? In this course, we will attempt to answer these questions by exploring the philosophical underpinnings, justifications, and criticisms of human rights.

This course, the first half of a two\u00ad semester sequence, moves from ancient\nAthens to medieval\nBaghdad, focusing on the emergence\nof philosophy as a practice and tradition in antiquity and its complex\ndialogue with revealed\nreligion in the first millennium CE. Major figures\nto be discussed include Plato, Aristotle, Epicurus, Epictetus, Sextus Empiricus, Plotinus, Ibn Sina and AI-Ghazali. We will read these authors\nas sources of intellectual provocation on a wide range of topics,\nincluding: the nature\nof the mind, self, or soul; the origin\nand structure of the universe;\nthe best life for human beings; the grounds and sources of genuine knowledge; and the proper aims and methods\nof philosophy itself.\nThis course is a requirement for philosophy majors beginning with the class of 2020. It is also a prerequisite for Philosophy 204: History of Philosophy II.",

This distinction is important as areas with a legacy of epistemological colonialism, like the Caribbean, have many works that contain a substratum of philosophical ideas but have not necessarily been welcomed as canonical works of philosophy. Thus we will seek to engage in philosophy as a questioning activity that attempts to answer epistemic, aesthetic, normative and metaphysical questions. Some threads of analysis unique to this geography that this course will cover, include: the idea that philosophy is a contextual project rooted in a specific place rather than an abstract, ideal theory; the effect of colonialism on culture and education; the exploration of creolization; and the critical analysis of \"modernity\" as a European project. Course texts include works by Edouard Glissant, Wilson Harris, Eugenio Maria Hostos, Julia de Burgos and Franz Fanon. Class size: 15",

From there we will move to Hume's essay on taste, looking into the distinction between subjective and objective judgement and the nature of aesthetic perception. We will then progress to a close reading of Kant's Critique of Judgement, in which we will explore questions of aesthetic perception, judgement, ethics and aesthetics, the beautiful, and the sublime. We will end with an examination of the transition to the aesthetics of romanticism and nineteenth-century aesthetic thought. This course satisfies the Junior Seminar requirement. Class size: 15",

The course will review the ideas of a few major thinkers such as Adam Smith, Karl Marx, Karl Polanyi, Thorstein Veblen, John Maynard Keynes, and John Kenneth Galbraith, and will introduce students to two subfields in particular: international political economy and the political economy of development. Among the questions we would ask are: Why are some countries rich and others poor? What is development? What are the prime movers of globalization? Is the US an empire given its influence and power in the global economy? How can development be redefined to tackle the challenge of climate change? Among issues that we will look at closely is the role of organizations such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the World Trade Organization in managing the global economy and the current debates about reforming these institutions.

Indigent defendants are falsely convicted, and even executed for crimes they did not commit. We say that law is the institutional embodiment of justice.

In this world, you have the law.\" This course explores the apparent disconnect between law and justice. Can contemporary legal systems offer justice? Can we, today, still speak of a duty to obey the law? Is it possible for law to do justice? Through readings of legal cases as well as political, literary, and philosophical texts, we seek to understand the problem of administering justice as it emerges in the context of contemporary legal institutions.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Global & International Studies (GIS core course); Human Rights What does it mean to be a global citizen? This question has gained increasing salience as the world has become more globalized. With globalization new problems surface that cut across national borders and fall outside the jurisdiction of individual nation-states. In response new forms of political organization have emerged to address these problems, which challenge the state as the primary locus of political authority and ultimate source of individual rights. In particular, these individuals and groups have appealed to a kind of global citizenship from below to call for action on and demand redress for the harms created by globalization. This interdisciplinary course critically examines the conceptual and theoretical foundations of the concept of global citizenship and investigates how the idea might work in practice. We begin by considering the conceptual, philosophical and historical debates about citizenship. What does it mean to be a citizen of a particular state? What obligations and responsibilities accompany citizenship? How have understandings of citizenship changed and expanded over time? What is global citizenship and how does it differ from national citizenship? Next we evaluate these ideas about citizenship in the context of globalization and the new problems created by an increasingly interdependent world. Topics covered may include: migration and refugees; the environment and resources; (in)security and borders; health and infectious disease; and development and inequality. We conclude by assessing the role (if any) global citizenship can play in global governance and consider how the international system might be transformed to better address the challenges of globalization.This course will be taught concurrently at Bard's international partner institutions. Students will benefit from collaboration with peers at these institutions. ",

The course is organized in three main sections. The first provides a broad historical overview of patterns of political development in Latin  America from the independence period to the present. The second part highlights theoretical approaches to Latin American political development drawn from cultural analysis, Marxism, and state-centric perspectives. The third and final section examines democratic development in five Latin American countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Cuba, and Venezuela). Class size: 18",

We will examine ancient and modern works by (among others) Sophocles, Thucydides, Aristotle, Nietzsche, and Arendt.

Is obeying the law more important than doing the right thing? Can a democratic order be founded without an initial act of violence? If popular entertainment truly shapes our political culture, should we therefore approve government censorship? Through these texts we will how classical tragedy gives us a form of political, ethical, and historical thinking that has been taken up by many political theorists. Our task in this class is to see how thinking tragically has been used to illuminate, and navigate, ethical and political conflicts; and to ask how such thinking might remain important today.

        "department": "politicalstudies",
        "description": "Cross-listed: Global & International Studies This 200-level introduction to American foreign policy, open to first year students, offers students a chronological and thematic overview of American foreign policy through the Age of Trump. The course examines the rise of a distinctive American foreign policy tradition marked by contentious democratic debate and the participation of many different voices and viewpoints in the formation and discussion of American foreign policy. Students will see how foreign policy and domestic politics have been closely linked throughout American history and understand the ideological and interest-based politics that shaped the American foreign policy process over time. In addition to Professor Mead\u2019s Special Providence: American Foreign Policy and How It Changed the World, students will study works by realist scholars such as James Chace and George Kennan. Among the questions to be considered: How do ideology and interest interact in the formation of American foreign policy? Do the same forces that drive domestic politics also drive foreign policy? How do identity and socio-economic status help shape the foreign policy debate? Can one speak of \"American strategy\" and if so, who or what is the strategist? Students will participate in discussions and debates with Russian students who will be reading many of the same texts in a parallel course being taught at the Smolny College/Faculty of Liberal Arts and Sciences at St. Petersburg State University in Russia. Additional video sessions with students in other countries will be scheduled when possible. The course instructors are active practitioners in the field of American foreign policy and will share their real world perspectives and experiences with the students in the class. .Class size: 20",

        "department": "politicalstudies",
        "description": "Cross-listed: Human Rights What is democracy? What are its benefits and perils? Who ought to be included in \"the people\"? These questions have preoccupied political theorists since ancient times. In recent years, they have also taken on urgency as democracy has become conflated with individual liberty and the free market. This class introduces students to the study of democratic theory. We will examine classical accounts of democracy by canonical political theorists. We will also focus on the way American and European radicals-especially socialists, feminists, and black nationalists-redefined its scope, transforming democracy into a fighting creed for greater political inclusion, participatory citizenship, and economic equality. Our goal is understand the rich, conflictual history of the concept, the better to understand what \"the rule of the people\" ought to mean today. This course is part of the College Seminar on Crises of Democracy; students will be required to attend parts of the Hannah Arendt Center Conference \"Crises of Democracy\" on Oct. 12-13.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Global & International Studies; Russian & Eurasian Studies In the 1980-90s, Soviet and Russian society underwent catastrophic turmoil, simultaneously experiencing a democratic revolution, the dissolution of an empire, and societal collapse. The end of the communist project in Russia did not lead to a standard normalizing \"transition\" to a liberal democracy, but produced instead a dramatic chain of events. An attempt at neoliberal economic reform coincided with a deep economic crisis, a reclamation of power by former communist officials, and a tendency toward a social anomie. The result, politically, was a gradual construction of an authoritarian regime and the formation of a political culture that is obsessed with a \"geo-political\" competition with \"West\" and sharply polarized between the conservative and liberal sensibilities. Why did the Soviet Union collapse? Why did the democratic revolution fail? Why has the most \"left-wing\" country in the world become one of the most \"right-wing\" countries in the world? Why have nationalism and imperialism reemerged in a time of globalization? Why does contemporary authoritarianism use elections, courts, and sociological surveys as its indispensable instruments of governance? The course will explore these and other questions in relying on the readings in political science, history, sociology, and cultural studies, as well as film and literary fiction. Class size: 22",

Beyond the headlines, however, there are developing trends, emerging actors and competing explanations that are often overlooked. This course examines the international politics in MENA using the theoretical tools of international relations. Major themes include the nature of the state system in the MENA and its creation; the causes of conflict within the region; the roles played by outside powers; and the causes and effects of transnational forces such as Arab nationalism, Islamic radicalism, criminal networks, media and global economic actors. The course will also explore the nature of sub-state and sectarian identities and the effects on regional politics (ie, Sunni vs Shi\u2019i Islam, Kurds, Amazigh. These themes are explored in the context of several case studies, including, but not limited to, the Algerian civil war in the 1990s, the wars in Iraq, the revolution in Libya, and the ongoing crisis in Syria. The course will offer students a better understanding of the international politics of the MENA and will help students appreciate the competing pressures on policymakers as the region changes in rapid and complex ways.  The course will also highlight ways in which international relations theory can be applied to real-world situations.Class size: 22",

The first generation of scholarsviewed the process somewhat optimistically as the global extension ofmodernity. Neo-Marxist critics tried to locate Third Worldunderdevelopment in the history of colonialism and in the persistenceof structures of dependency of Third  World countries. \"Post-development\" theorists took on the idea of development itself. Globalization and the emergence of a new international division oflabor, has reframed the debates. Developing countries like Argentina,Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico and South Africa are nowmembers of the G-20 group of countries, which many see as a likelysuccessor to the G8 group of leading industrial economies.

While only recently coming to dominate the US national security agenda, terrorism as a political activity has a long history. This seminar will provide a theoretical and empirical examination of terrorism as a political phenomenon. The first part of the course will explore the conceptual and theoretical debates surrounding terrorism. Topics discussed will include the distinctions between terrorism and other forms of political violence, why individuals and groups resort to terrorism to achieve political goals, the role of religion and ideology in motivating terrorist groups, and the importance of state sponsorship in supporting terrorist activity. The second part will address the challenges of counterterrorism, including the strengths and weaknesses of counterterrorist tools such as military force, diplomacy, intelligence and law enforcement, the relationship between counterterrorism and democracy, the role of the international community in stopping terrorism. Throughout the course special effort will be made to situate the US experience with terrorism in a comparative and historical perspective through an examination of prominent case studies drawn from different regions and time periods.

        "department": "politicalstudies",
        "description": "Cross-listed: American Studies; Human Rights; Philosophy This seminar is an exploration of radical American democracy. While most characterizations of democracy see it as a form of government, this course explores the essence of democracy as a specifically modern way of life. To do so, it turns to some great thinkers of American democracy such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, Walt Whitman, Ralph Ellison, W. E. B. DuBois, and Hannah Arendt. What unites these radical democrats is the conviction that democracy is a practice of individuals rather than an institutional form of governance. As an ideal of radical individualism, American democratic thought offers, perhaps surprisingly, an aristocratic critique of the limits of democratic government even as it, seen from another side, makes possible our culture of narcissistic consumerism. Our aim is to understand the democratic spirit of radical individualism that has proven so seductive and powerful since its modern birth in the American revolution. Texts will include Emerson\u2019s essays The American Scholar and Experience, Thoreau\u2019s Walden, Ellison\u2019s Invisible Man and Arendt\u2019s On Revolution. This course is part of the College Seminar on Crises of Democracy; students will be required to attend parts of the Hannah Arendt Center Conference \"Crises of Democracy\" on Oct. 12-13.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Global & International Studies; Human Rights Almost alone among the world\u2019s nations, the United States has made promoting democracy abroad an objective of its foreign policy. The origins of what has been called \"America\u2019s Mission\" runs from the very birth of the American Republic, when the founding fathers declared the United States to be \"an exemplar state\" to guide the political development of other nations, to George W. Bush\u2019s attempt to remake Iraq into \"a beacon of democracy in the Middle East.\" This course explores three core questions about America\u2019s attempts to promote democracy abroad. What explains the genesis and persistence of the centrality of democratic promotion in American foreign policy? How have American administrations endeavored to construct policies to advance democratic development on a global scale?And why have American attempts to create democracies abroad have so often fallen short of their intended goals? These questions are examined through a broad review of the debate about the role of democracy and human rights in U.S. foreign policy; what theories of democratization have to say about democratic promotion, and, finally, in-depth analyses of American efforts to promote democracy in Western Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East.

Artifacts and archaeological investigations have played a major part in the reconstruction of the meanings involved, while the depth of texts -- as compositions that took shape over time -- has been increasingly appreciated. This seminar involves understanding the social histories of Israel and the early Church as they shaped the biblical texts. This approach identifies the constituencies for which the sources of the texts were produced. By \"sources\" we mean, not the documents as they stand (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, and so on), but the traditions that fed into those documents. The final, editorial moment when traditions were crystallized in writing is a vital juncture in the literary formation of the Scriptures, but is not solely determinative of their meaning. The unfolding of meanings within texts during the whole of their development explodes the claim of a single, exclusive meaning in biblical exegesis. The seminar will attend to the variety of meanings inherent within the Scriptures -- without limitation to a particular theory of interpretation, and with constant attention to issues of historical context.

We will read selections from various midrashic compilations, apply different critical tools for understanding them, and consider their relationship to later forms of literature and criticism.

The discipline views the individual in context of the larger society, and sheds light on how social structures constrain and enable our choices and actions. Sociologists study topics as varied as race, gender, class, religion, the birth of capitalism, democracy, education, crime and prisons, the environment, and inequality. At its most basic, the course will teach students how to read social science texts and evaluate their arguments. Conceptually, students will learn basic sociological themes and become familiar with how sociologists ask and answer questions. Most importantly, students will come away from the course with a new understanding of how to think sociologically about the world around them, their position in society, and how their actions both affect and are affected by the social structures in which we all live.

What are the sources of this inequality? Is social inequality inevitable? Is it undesirable? Through lectures, documentary films and class discussions, this course examines the ways by which socially-defined class, gender, race and ethnic categories are unevenly rewarded for their social contributions. Sociological theories are used to explain how and why social inequality is produced and maintained, and how it affects the well-being of individuals and social groups. The course will focus on two general themes. The first deals with the structure of inequality while studying the unequal distribution of material and social resources (e.g., social status, wealth, power). The second examines the processes that determine the allocation of people to positions in the stratification system (e.g. educational attainment, social capital, parental wealth, institutional discrimination).

Most of our time, however, will be spent with contemporary authors in the new and developing field of \"economic sociology.\" These authors help us to see the ways that the economy is \"embedded\" in society and in culture: in worldviews, in moral frameworks, and in social-relational structures. Topics covered in the course will include: (1) social patterns of consumption, (2) commodification of emotion in the service economy, (3) roles of law and social action in the branding of products and places, (4) social foundations of modern, industrial capitalism, and (5) social, moral, and legal meanings of money.

The course will be concerned with the theory and rationale upon which social research is based, as well as the practical aspects of research and the problems the researcher is likely to encounter. The course is divided into two parts. In the first, we will learn how to formulate research questions and hypotheses, how to choose the appropriate research method for the problem, and how to maximize chances for valid and reliable findings. In the second part, we will learn how to perform simple data analysis and how to interpret and present findings in a written report. For a final paper, students use data from the U.S. General Social Survey (GSS) to study public attitudes toward issues such as abortion, immigration, inequality and welfare, affirmative action, gender roles, religion, the media, and gun laws. By the end of the semester, students will have the necessary skills for designing and conducting independent research for term papers and senior projects, as well as for non-academic enterprises.

It asks how sexual identities and social categories of sexuality come to be and how they are maintained or changed over time. It examines how historically specific social contexts shape the meaning of sexual experiences and how we use sexuality to define ourselves, produce social hierarchies, and mark moral boundaries. We will begin with an introduction to theories of sexuality and consider the essentialist / constructionist debate. Then we use a historical perspective to look at the social institutions that help to produce, construct, and control sexual practice and identities, paying special attention to the role of gender, race, and class inequality. This will provide a basis for looking at the development of modern sexual communities, identities, and politics, including controversies over commodified sexuality and feminist debates about prostitution and pornography. Throughout the course will consider the important role of gender in the social organization of sexuality. We will also address how these social processes shape notions of personal identity and the self. Class size: 22",

        "description": "Cross-listed: Historical Studies; Political Studies Classical sociological thinkers were unapologetic about thinking big. They sought to uncover the architectonic social forces of historical and cultural change, and to peer into the future toward which such forces might be leading. Has a new type of capitalism taken over the world? Have social ties like friendship and marriage been changed out of all recognition by new social conditions? Does religion still matter in modern societies, and, if so, how? In this course, we will survey the \"grand narrative tradition\" of sociology. We will begin with classical exemplars of this tradition, including Karl Marx, Max Weber, W.E.B. Du Bois, and Emile Durkheim. We will look at authors from outside the boundaries of canonical sociology, including Karl Jaspers and Henry Sumner Maine. And we will study more contemporary authors, such as Michel Foucault, Robert Bellah, Michael Mann, Samuel Huntington, and Philip Gorski. One goal of this course will be to help students reflectively develop research projects that involve historical and comparative research, or historical themes. Another goal of the course will be to help students consider the strengths and the weaknesses of macro-historical sociology. This course is part of the College Seminar on Crises of Democracy; students will be required to attend parts of the Hannah Arendt Center Conference \"Crises of Democracy\" on Oct. 12-13.

It engages theoretical questions about relationship between the self and power, social control, the state, and the construction of knowledge. In doing so, the course also engages debates over agency and individualism. This subject straddles political and cultural sociology and links the micro-level of everyday experience with macro-level questions of power and politics. It covers the symbolic interactionist approach to social control, including Goffman, and how sociology broke with Enlightenment ideas about the individual. We delve into qualitative and historical research on patterns of governance and subjectivity in many contexts, including paid labor, consumer culture, psychological treatment, prisons, self-help groups, and reproductive policy. About half of the course focuses on the \"governmentality\" scholarship associated with Foucault that examines how authorities think about and enact forms of regulation and control. The course will enable students to examine questions of subjectivity and individuality, recent shifts toward \"neoliberal\" governance, and the politics of empowerment.",

        "description": "Cross-listed: Environmental & Urban Studies; Global & International Studies Non-state actors have gained increasing importance in international affairs, and the expanded role of cities is often overlooked. Particularly in the post-9/11 era, cities are directly managing a wide variety of international issues and are hubs for the international movement of people, money and ideas. New York City is the ideal case study: city police are deployed overseas to monitor terrorist networks, financial institutions manage the global flow of trillions of dollars, the UN is the headquarters of international diplomacy, the city hosts a diverse mix of NGOs and major media, and New York is the destination for immigrants arriving from all corners of the world. This course explores the theoretical debates and practical policy effects of cities as non-state actors in international affairs. How should we define non-state actors? Where do cities fit in those debates? What strategies do different non-state actors use to influence national and global policy-making, with a particular focus on cities? In addition, the course contextualizes students\u2019 internship experiences within this broader discussion to critically examine how ideas about the role of non-state actors in world politics play out in practice. We will take advantage of our New York City location with guest speakers from a wide spectrum of organizations within the field, such as the United Nations, US State Department, New York Police Department, the Federal Reserve, Human Rights Watch, New York State Homeland Security, Council on Foreign Relations, World Policy Institute, Open Society Foundation, and many others.

This fact is an historic anomaly; at no time in history has any one state amassed the degree of military, economic, and political power the United States now enjoys. In fact, contemporary American foreign policy is premised on the assertion that the United   States must sustain its primacy against any potential challengers for the indefinite future. This course explores the character of power and war in this era of American hegemony. We will examine the vigorous debates over the objectives of American power, unilateralism versus multilateralism as rival approaches to exercising power, debates over what military power can actually achieve, and the potential for a global backlash against the United   States. Among other specific issues this course will address is the rise of China and India and the implications for global security and economic issues; rogue states and nuclear proliferation; the preventive war option to address shifting threats; the political and strategic future of the Middle East; terrorism as an alternative form of the power struggle and as a type of asymmetric warfare waged by nonstate actors; the continuing problem of humanitarian crises, failed states and intervention in the post-9/11 world; and the changing nature of global energy politics as an acute security issue.",

Born of experiments in art and science, the medium combines vision and technology. It possesses a uniquely intimate relation to the real and for this reason has many applications outside the realm of fine art; nevertheless, from its inception photography has been a vehicle for artistic aspirations. This survey of the history of photography from its earliest manifestations to the 2000s considers the medium's applications - as art, science, historical record, and document. This course is open to all students and is the prerequisite for most other courses in the history of photography. (Art History requirement: Modern) Class size: 22",

The land, sea, animals, fish, reptiles, and human body--all served as objects of study, contemplation, and delight for early modern viewers. Curious artists and observers were enabled in their endeavors by recent technologies (the microscope and telescope) and recording methods (printmaking), while an insatiable audience for images of nature provided a ready market. Nature was celebrated as divine creation and explored as a place of violence and mystery. Her boundaries were tested and recorded in maps and landscape paintings, while her bounty was pictured in spectacular still life paintings, often staged as a contest between nature and art. Cultivated nature provided a place to play in the form of elaborate gardens, while more sedentary pleasures were to be found by armchair travelers immersed in the pages of books illustrating landscapes near and far. Early modern interest in the natural world was pan-European, but the course will focus on images, objects, and environments from present day Germany, Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands. Media and materials to be discussed include: painting (still life, landscape, hunt scenes), drawings (anatomy studies, botanical illustrations), New World specimens, travel literature, anatomy lessons.

To imagine and write about a future ideal society requires a reconsideration of the ways in which life will be organized in space. Utopian thinkers utilized drawings, maps, and plans to give shape to their vision and illustrate future social and political reconfigurations. From Sir Thomas More\u2019s Amaurote (1535) to Charlotte Perkins Gilman\u2019s Herland (1915) and Hakim Bey\u2019s The Temporary Autonomous Zone (1991), authors challenged the limits of imagination, providing designers opportunities for architectural experimentation. This course will examine key writings and architectural projects in an effort to unpack the history of utopian thought since the discovery of the New World, considering projects for socialist utopias, communes, and industrial colonies.

The course explores how a deepening knowledge of antiquity (the invention of archaeology!), an ongoing development of art/architectural theory, and the continued study of the natural world crafted a visual vocabulary able to address the existential challenge posed by the Protestant north. Beginning with Leonardo da Vinci, the class analyzes the contributions of Michelangelo, Raphael, and the so-called Mannerists. In addition to secondary scholarship, readings incorporate primary sources by Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Vasari. Requirements include a mid-term, a final, a critical essay, and a research paper on a work in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Open to all students.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Latin American & Iberian Studies Andr\u00e9 Breton, founder and leader of the Surrealist Movement, first visited Mexico in 1938 and the Caribbean in 1941. Politically supportive of Latin America\u2019s struggle against European imperialism, Breton was deeply interested in both its art and culture, and had a large personal collection of ethnographic artifacts. Surrealist journals and artists extolled \"primitive\" mythologies and were captivated by such \"exotic\" artists as Frida Kahlo and Wifredo Lam. This course plans to explore two areas: the rich and varied field of surrealism in both literature and the arts of Latin America and, to question the Surrealist fascination with non-Western culture. As numerous critics have noted, surrealism came alive in Latin America at the moment when it was waning in Europe, and continued to develop throughout the twentieth century. By looking through the double lens of art and literature, we will tease out answers to such questions as: What geographical, political, and/or social factors contributed to the widespread growth of Surrealism in Latin America? In what ways did cross-fertilization take place among the countries of Latin America, and between these countries and Europe? Did Latin American artists always feel comfortable being labeled \"Surrealist\" or was it viewed as another form of colonization? In what ways did the European Surrealists project their fantasies regarding the psychic power of the \"primitive\" onto Latin American creative production? Finally, we will examine the ways in which Surrealism and its influences survive in contemporary cultural production. Permission of the instructor required.

We will pursue relevant questions such as: what exactly are the criteria for inclusion in such categories, do art markets drive this labeling, how does this work function within the art world, are categorical borders crossed in order to fit the needs of exhibiting institutions, and finally how has Outsider Art impacted mainstream modern and contemporary art and are the dividing lines between the two still relevant? We will look at artwork produced within certain institutional settings such as mental asylums and prisons, as well as that produced by mediums, spiritualists and other \"visionaries\" working within what can be best described as a \"folk art\" category.

        "description": "Cross-listed: French Studies The mid-eighteenth to the mid-nineteenth century, a period brimming over with revolution and political upheaval in Europe, witnessed profound changes in the way art was produced, understood, criticized, marketed, distributed and exhibited. This course seeks to introduce major themes, objects, persons, and social currents of European Art from the 1770s to the 1850s. We will follow currents in Spain, Germany, Great Britain, and France. Major topics include changing definitions of neoclassicism and romanticism; the impact of the revolutions of 1789, 1830, and 1848; the Napoleonic presence abroad; the shift from history painting to scenes of everyday life; landscape painting as an autonomous art form; and attitudes toward race and sexuality. We will try to understand artworks from three distinct perspectives: the social, the aesthetic, and the political, and investigate how these forces intersected to both create and reflect \"the modern\" as it is understood today. However, revivalism, tradition, and conservative reaction were equally powerful factors in shaping the art of the period, and we will be particularly interested in the push and pull of old, new, and in-between. We do not cover architecture and sculpture in this course. There will be two research papers, two exams, and a class presentation.

In Rome, the first week focuses on the ancient city, studying the evolving role of public monuments as the republic transformed into an empire. The second week explores post-antique (up to the present day) reconfiguration of antiquities in order to construct political and theological meaning. The portion of the class in Rome is rigorous, consisting of over seventy hours of lectures at archaeological sites, in museums, and in churches. During the spring semester, the class analyzes the art seen in Rome and discusses the secondary scholarship. Requirements include two presentations (one on texts, one on art), two exams, and a research paper. The prerequisite for the class is successful completion of either Roman Art and Architecture (ARTH 210), Roman Urbanism (ARTH 227), or 16th-century Italian Renaissance Art, Architecture, and Urbanism (ArtH 236). The class is limited to sixteen students; priority is based on academic relevance and intellectual maturity. The cost of the Rome component is circa $1700 to include transportation in Rome, lodging, breakfast, museum admissions, and all but two dinners. Airfare is not included, and financial aid does not assist with this fee. Credit will only be awarded upon successful completion of both components of the class. Permission of the professor required.

The relationships between the artistic traditions of their native lands and their subsequent immersion in American culture provide material for fascinating inquiries concerning biography, style, subject matter, and politics. This class will examine artists active in the United States in the first half of the twentieth century as well as contemporary artists. We will take one or two trips to New York City to see art by Asian American artists, and the class will read several works of fiction by Asian American writers to supplement the art history readings. Students will give presentations about selected artists either historic or recent. Key artists studied will include Isamu Noguchi, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, Yun Gee, Yayoi Kusama, Yoko Ono, Nam June Paik, Patty Chang, Nikki Lee and Mariko Mori.

This course is designed for students wishing to experience an intense, three-dimensional study of modern dance rooted in and responding to the work and ideas of Trisha Brown. Technique class is structured as a laboratory where physical possibilities are explored with a mixture of rigor and freedom, specificity and abandon. Technique class will also be a place of critical thinking, where evaluation of movement concepts occurs through physical exercises, group discussions, and written reflection. Students must have a strong technical foundation, be self-motivated, and be capable of handling the demands of a four-day-a-week class. Readings, written assignments, and attendance at performances outside of regular class hours are essential aspects of the course, augmenting our intellectual understanding of technique and performance. Co-taught by Leah Cox and Trisha Brown Dance Company faculty. This class meets 4 days per week. Prerequisite: Sophomore status with the intention to moderate; ideally, students will have had two semesters of Intermediate-level modern courses.

What constitutes a game? Why do people play them? What makes digital gamesdifferent from non-digital games? What roles do games play in contemporary culture? How have game-like incentive systems and other forms of \"gamification\" infused non-game contexts, such as socialmedia, fine art, democracy, education, war, and the modern workplace? Do games and \"gamer\" cultureeffectively preclude, privilege, include, or exclude certain groups, identities, and worldviews? Coursereadings, screenings, and mandatory game play will augment and inform our investigation of thesequestions and beyond. The primary coursework will consist of game creation using tools and methodologies from computerscience and electronic art.

This work will be augmented by short assignments designed to buildfluency in visual art creation and interactive game design through short exercises in coding in Javascript,visual design applications, and Unity, a game design application. Assignments will push students todevelop experimental and critical approaches to game creation. This course is restricted to students in the lower college. Students with little experience playing games and/or a healthy skepticism about the cultural and artisticvalue of games are encouraged to apply.

Course participants develop ways of using video's most fundamental property: its ability to reproduce a stream of real-time synchronized images and sounds. How does video technology mediate between on-screen performer and audience? How can artists interested in creating critical and self-reflexive media respond to video\u2019s immediacy and \"liveness\"? How can performance artists use video playback devices, displays, projectors, and interactive elements to shape and enhance live art? Course participants will work on individual projects using cameras, monitors, switchers, surveillance systems, projectors, and software-based video mixers. The first half of the course concentrates on the creation of performance \"tapes\" (or tape-less video documents) and the history of experimental video focused on framing staged live activities. The second half of the course concentrates on the use of video as a central component within live art events, plus a continued discussion about the larger cultural and psychological impact of live video production.

        "description": "Operating on the assumption that the study of film, a syncretic art par excellence, offers a particularly advantageous perspective on understanding the aesthetic underpinnings of 20th Century art, the course explores the relationship between a certain mode of cinematic achievement, for the most part labeled avant-garde, and the major tenets of modernist art, both visual and literary. Many of the films studied are by artists who worked in other media (such as L\u00e9ger, Strand, Cornell, and Duchamp) or whose work manifests a direct relationship to various artistic movements such as surrealism, futurism, and constructivism. An attempt is made to relate certain films to parallel achievements in photography, poetry, and music, with some attention paid to relatively little-seen filmmakers such as Lye, Kinugasa, and Jennings. Much of the assigned reading is not film criticism as such, but crucial critical works that help to define modernism in general, including those by Baudelaire, Pound, Ortega y Gasset, Moholy-Nagy, and Brecht. Other films studied are by (Europeans) Vertov, Eisenstein, Bu\u00f1uel, Dulac, Ruttmann, Man Ray; and (American) Deren, Brakhage, Anger, Snow, Gehr, Conner, Rainer, Frampton, et al.

Among other things, we will examine Bergman\u2019s relationship to Scandinavian artistic, theatrical, and theological traditions; his relationship to his contemporaries; and his influence on subsequent generations, with a special focus on film style, film sound, cinematic adaptation, and artistic representations of gesture and the human figure. In addition to studying many of Bergman\u2019s features, we will watch films by such wide-ranging directors as Carl Theodor Dreyer, Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m, Mauritz Stiller, Lars von Trier, Andrei Tarkovsky, and Michael Haneke. We will read a range of relevant criticism, along with contextual material and works by figures such as Henrik Ibsen, August Strindberg, and S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard. Grades based on in-class discussion, short writing assignments, and a final research essay. Upper-college students who have taken courses in film criticism and history will have priority.

From the other Stein-Thomson The Mother of Us All through Harry Partch\u2019s vernacular dance-plays to Robert Ashley\u2019s road operas for television to Meredith Monk\u2019s nonverbal Atlas to the information overload of Glass\u2019s Einstein on the Beach to Mikel Rouse\u2019s complexly pop theater works, American composers have often constructed stage works from nonlinear narratives that completely sidestep assumptions of theatrical realism. At the same time, there is another American tradition of operas that distance themselves from Europe in subject matter, though not in format: Gershwin\u2019s Porgy and Bess, Copland\u2019s The Tender Land, John Adams\u2019s Nixon in China. The course will weave between these traditions, contrasting their effectiveness and looking for links that might define an American approach to opera.

Line, shape, value, gesture, volume, weight, composition and space form the basis for translating from 3D to 2D, and these will each be covered through weekly homework assignments and readings. We will look at old master drawings as well as contemporary artists in relationship to each of these assignments. A wide range of drawing materials will be introduced.

The issues discussed in Painting I, mainly the language of color, value, temperature, contrast, saturation, intensity, etc. and strong structural relationships, will serve as building blocks for complex figurative compositions. We will be also working from reproductions as we study some of the great figurative masters. Students will be expected to be on time and have the proper equipment. This includes a good assortment of brushes, a proper palette and the required colors. Students will be working on gessoed paper over the first weeks but should know how to stretch and prime a canvas properly. Some of the poses will extend over two weeks, which will allow students to begin to push their work into new places. This class is for students who want to work hard and extend themselves. Students should have experience in drawing and must have had Painting I, there will be no exceptions. Class size: 14",

        "description": "The monotype (a.k.a. the painterly print) emerges at the intersection of painting and printmaking. While technically it can be the moststraightforward and direct form of printmaking, one that strives *to honor the individuality of the hand\u2019s painterly impulse\", it also can be fantastically inventive and layered, incorporating many processes into one image. Monotypes are a wonderful tool for an artist to develop ideas of color, light, shape, and composition into singular expressions. In turn, they can become a rich resource of stimulation and information for other forms of visual thinking. This class will explore the process of the monotype in relation to painting using both traditional techniques and experimental ones that evolve in response to the pursuit of student\u2019s individual ideas. While specific assignments will be given in class, independence in direction and motivation is essential. This course\u2019s success depends on the evolving dialogue between your visual ideas and the monotype process. This means that you must come to this course with visual ideas that you intend to develop, whether abstract or representational, or both. Painting 1 or Printmaking I are the minimum prerequisites but it is highly recommended that you have had some experience with the pursuit of visual ideas of your own invention. Material needs will vary among individuals, but an array of oil painting materials and high quality paper will be required by all. Class size: 14",

He was of course referring to her best-selling novel, Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin, a seminal work of 19th century American literature. It also has been adapted many times for the theater and performed all over the United States in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. We will examine the important role this work played in the birth of an American theater and culture. We will begin with a close reading of the novel, then turn our attention to the various theatrical adaptations that were produced and toured the United States over the years. Among the questions that will be examined include: What role did the novel and its theatrical adaptations play in the formation of American culture and what do its theatrical adaptations tell us about what it means to perform \"American\"? What does it mean for its archetypal characters to be portrayed by performers of different races or genders? Also, we will look at the uses or misuses of dramatic literature as a form of popular entertainment as well as early American propaganda. Important to our inquiry are the relationships between Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin, blackface and the roles, race and gender play in the creation of a contemporary American culture. Other works to be examined include Spike Lee\u2019s movie \"Bamboozled,\" the contemporary Broadway hit \"Hamilton,\" George C. Wolf\u2019s musical \"The Colored Museum,\" and \"Funnyhouse of a Negro\" by contemporary playwright Adrienne Kennedy. Close readings, in-class discussions, film screenings, performance projects, personal essays, and other project-based explorations of texts will round out the class. Class size: 28",

        "description": "Cross-listed: Medieval Studies Itwas over the course of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance that the concept of the author, as we now conceive of it, first emerged. When a literary work is composed, who is it who composes it? To what extent does such a work represent the general culture out of which it emerged, and to what extent does it reflect an individual consciousness? How does our assumption of who the author is affect how our reading of the text? We will be keeping these questions in mind as we examine the shift in medieval and Renaissance literature from epic to lyric and romance; from orally-based literature to written texts; and from anonymous poets to professional writers. Texts to be read will includeThe Song of Roland, troubadour lyrics, Arthurian romances,The Romance of the Rose, Dante'sInferno, Petrarch\u2019s sonnets, Boccaccio\u2019sDecameron, Christine dePizan'sBook of the City of Ladies, and Francois Villon'sTestament.

        "description": "This course explores seventeenth- and eighteenth-century literature in England, during a vital transition between a period of dissent, struggle and war to an achieved modernity, a nation of divergent identities in compromise. The seventeenth century\u2019s characteristic figure is Satan struggling against God in John Milton\u2019s Paradise Lost \u2013 but other poets and dramatists like John Donne, Ben Jonson, and Andrew Marvell helped to shape the age\u2019s passionate interest in the conflict of political, religious, and social ideas and values. After the Civil War and the Puritan rule, monarchy was restored, at least as a reassuring symbol, and writers were free to play up the differences as they did in the witty, bawdy dramatic comedies of the elites and the stories and novels by Aphra Behn, Henry Fielding, and Laurence Sterne which appealed to middle-class readers. This course counts as pre-1800 offering.",

        "department": "worldlit",
        "description": "Cross-listed: Human Rights; Jewish Studies; Russian & Eurasian Studies Isaac Babel (1894-1940) was one of the most perplexing geniuses of twentieth century Russian and European literature. Babel enlisted as a Jew in the famously anti-Semitic Cossack division of the Red Cavalry in 1920 and soon thereafter became one of the most famous writers in Soviet Russia; he escaped the fury of the Great Terror of 1937-38 only to be arrested in the spring of 1939 and shot as a traitor in 1940. The sum total of his writings was meager in comparison with that of most of his contemporaries; his political ambiguities are frequently infuriating; his defiant ironies often without clear target; his captivating literary style a puzzle of images and absences. He spoke of himself as \"the master of the genre of silence.\" In this class, we will attempt to unravel some of his many paradoxes through close readings of his masterpiece Red Cavalry, the 1920 Diary and The Odessa Stories. Background critical and historical texts, such as writings by Leon Trotsky, A. K. Voronsky, Vladimir Mayakovsky and pronouncements and documents of the Soviet government will provide a framework for understanding Babel\u2019s struggle as both Jew and Russian, as both a writer deeply imbued with the spirit of western humanism and one committed to the triumph of the Bolshevik Revolution, and as both an incessant prankster and reflective spiritual vagabond. This class will examine his many attempts at finding a literary center that resolves the radical contradictions between his relation to tradition and to the growing nightmare of Soviet reality.

Within the literary sphere, there has been publishing explosion of writings by jil al-shabab (or the youth generation), paralleled by increased international interest and enthusiastic translation projects. This course will introduce students to recent writings in Arabic literature, paying particular attention how these authors and their texts challenge and transcend literary norms and traditions. We will consider how questions of genre and linguistic registers are complicated, and how recent literary works are in conversations that blur boundaries and expand across media.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Africana Studies; Human Rights; Latin American & Iberian Studies; Middle Eastern Studies This seminar considers how culture in the third world became a theater for Cold War, focusing on the 1950s-1970s. The course begins with the 1955 Bandung Conference and its call for Afro-Asian solidarity and non-alignment in the face of the either/or logic of Cold War. Aiming to curate a global \"non-Communist Left\" in its fight against Soviet cultural initiatives, the covertly CIA-founded and \u2013funded Congress for Cultural Freedom extended its efforts well beyond Europe after Bandung, beginning highly influential literary magazines, including Quest in India, Black Orpheus in Nigeria, Transition in Uganda, Hiwar in Lebanon, and several Latin American magazines, including the seminal Mundo Nuevo. The Soviets in turn built support for the Afro-Asian Writers Association, publishing their tri-lingual review of \"Afro-Asian writings\" \u2013 Lotus \u2013 from Cairo. In this course we will study the history of the Congress for Cultural Freedom and the Afro-Asian Writers Association after Bandung, reading selections from their Indian, Arab, African, and Latin American magazines, alongside theories of political commitment, decolonization, empire, liberalism, and Communism. Finally, the course will consider the context of cultural Cold War in the Caribbean, and the resurgent relevance of the Cold War to our own times, through a reading of Marlon James\u2019s recent novel A Brief History of Seven Killings.

Poetry itself, particularly when joined with music and dance by competing choruses, has established itself as its own kind of competitive event. This course will study the strange intersections of the physical, the social and the sacred we still recognize in sports. We will allot equal time to three different sets of readings: 1) case studies of the wedding of poetry to athletics in still thriving Oceanic cultures, from the Hawaiians to the Maori; 2) victory odes for the ancient Greek games, principally those of Pindar, praising victors in boxing, wrestling, running, pentathlon, pancratium (a.k.a Ultimate Fighting), chariot, and dithyramb; 3) sports poetry in Europe and the Americas, ranging from bullfighting and capoeira to ball games both in Classic Mesoamerica (Mayan and Aztec) and baseball poems in the 100 years. In all three parts we will not only study the poems themselves but also some scholarship by sports historians on the particular athletic events they reflect, and will view some video clips of the sports and poetry in action.

In this course you will be encouraged to think about how notions of childhood and teenagerdom are constructed and reproduced in Anglophone literature for young people, and to interrogate the social and literary structures that guide these representations. Our goal will be to gain familiarity with the history of children\u2019s literature in English and some of its major genres, while constantly challenging our own conceptions of childhood and literariness. How can we, as adults and critics, read a book that has been classed as \"children\u2019s literature\"? How do we theorize texts that are written for children by adults? What makes a work of children\u2019s literature a classic? Can we say that children\u2019s literature \"colonizes\" the child? Given their importance to contemporary ideas of the child, we will give special attention to questions of gender and sexuality throughout the semester. Course texts include literature by J.M. Barrie, C.S. Lewis, J.K. Rowling, Diana Wynne Jones, Toni Morrison, and M.T. Anderson, as well as a selection of picture books.",

        "department": "lit2courses",
        "description": "Cross-listed: Experimental Humanities When we think about Renaissance poetry, we tend to think of the sonnet: rule-bound, blatantly artificial, and old-fashioned. The funny thing is, the poets writing in the Renaissance tried everything they could to make their poems appear as just the opposite: organic, sincere, and excitingly new. Just beneath the veneer of formal qualities like rhyme and meter, poems from the period are sensitive and probing explorations of chaos, frustration, madness, desire, and the sublime. This course examines, by focusing on the theme of love as a psychological, emotional, and political concept, how poets in the period fought with language in order to make poetry say things that could not be said otherwise. Our units will consider how both the concept of love and the poetic techniques used to articulate it intersect in surprising ways with political subversion, queerness, and religious doubt. Through both critical assignments and creative exercises, including engaging with digital media to better understand how the technologies of publication and the expectations of popular culture shape the transmission of ideas, we\u2019ll hone a deep understanding of essential aspects of poetry while we think about how it was (and still is) a tool for thought and an instrument of emotional understanding. The course covers a broad range of major works as well as less commonly-read (yet nevertheless indelibly great) poetry, in particular poetry by women; Shakespeare, Spenser, Donne and Milton will take their place in context alongside Mary Sidney, Robert Herrick, Katherine Philips, George Herbert, Amelia Lanyer, and Margaret Cavendish.

        "description": "This course offers a critical introduction to the literature produced in Britain at the time of the Industrial Revolution, the French Revolution, and the Napoleonic wars. The term traditionally used to categorize this literature, \"romantic,\" is interestingly problematic: throughout the course we will question the assumptions built into this term instead of assuming that we know what it means or taking for granted a series of supposed characteristics of \"romantic\" literature and art. We will also explore the extent to which key conflicts in British culture during the \"romantic period,\" including the founding of the United States, independence movements in the Americas, the development of free trade ideology, and the debates over slavery and colonialism, are still at issue today. The centerpiece of this course is the close reading of poetry. There will also be a strong emphasis on the historical and social contexts of the works we are reading, and on the specific ways in which historical forces and social changes shape and are at times shaped by the formal features of literary texts. The question of whether \"romantic\" writing represents an active engagement with or an escapist idealization of the important historical developments in this period will be a continuous focus. Readings include canonical and non-canonical authors: William Blake, William Wordsworth, Helen Maria Williams, Thomas Beddoes, Anna Letitia Barbauld, Robert Southey, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Percy Bysshe Shelley, John Keats, Lord Byron, John Clare, and Laetitia Elizabeth Landon.

American liberalism has slipped into a kind of moral panic about racial, gender, and sexual identity that has distorted liberalism\u2019s message and prevented it from becoming a unifying force capable of governing.\" Colin Jost, ofSaturday Night Live\u2019s\"Weekend Update\" joked that: \"The dating app Tinder announced a new feature this week, which gives users 37 different gender identity options. It\u2019s called: Why Democrats Lost the Election.\" Since the election of Donald Trump, the media has pitted minorities against working-class whites, with particular vitriol towards to LGBTQ community. Why has this presumed divide become the scapegoat for the Democrat\u2019s electoral loss? 2016 also saw the release of the filmLoving, which demonstrates how the legal impetus to overturn anti-miscegenation laws came from the working class.

In asking about the status of the speaking human subject, we will look at the ways in which the subject of rights, and indeed the thought of human rights itself, derives from a 'literary' experience. These questions will be examined, if not answered, across a variety of literary, philosophical, legal and political texts, with a heavy dose of case studies (many of them happening right now) and readings in contemporary critical and legal theory.

        "description": "Cross-listed: American Studies; Literature; Theater 6 credits \"So you\u2019re the little lady who started the war,\" Abraham Lincoln allegedly told Harriet Beecher Stowe. He was of course referring to her best-selling novel, Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin, a seminal work of 19th century American literature. It also has been adapted many times for the theater and performed all over the United States in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. We will examine the important role this work played in the birth of American theater and culture. We will begin with a close reading of the novel, then turn our attention to the various theatrical adaptations that were produced and toured the United States over the years. Among the questions that will be examined include: What role did the novel and its theatrical adaptations play in the formation of American culture; what do its theatrical adaptations tell us about what it means to perform \"American\"? What does it mean for its archetypal characters to be portrayed by performers of different races or genders? Also, we will look at the uses or misuses of dramatic literature as a form of popular entertainment and as well as early American propaganda. Important to our inquiry is the relationship between Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin, Blackface and the roles race and gender played in the creation of a contemporary American culture. Other works to be examined include Spike Lee\u2019s movie \"Bamboozled,\" the contemporary Broadway hit \"Hamilton,\" George C. Wolf\u2019s musical \"The Colored Museum,\" and \"Funnyhouse of a Negro\" by contemporary playwright Adrienne Kennedy. Close readings, in-class discussions, film screenings, performance projects, personal essays field trips, museum visits and other project-based explorations of texts will round out the class.

From this intensely intimate vantage point, he was able to portray the south and all of its glory and shame. Within Faulkner\u2019s narratives, slavery and its aftermath remain the disaster at the heart of American History.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Mind, Brain, Behavior Sigmund Freud conceived of psychoanalysis as a body of theoretical knowledge and as a clinical practice grounded in listening and interpretation. It is Freud who taught us to read slips of the tongue, bungled actions, memory lapses, dreams, and symptoms as speech in their own right, and to understand them as formations of the unconscious. He also showed us how, beyond communication, speech and language are constitutive of human subjectivity. In addition to inventing a practice to help patients, Freud\u2019s influence spans art, literature, and the human sciences\u2014fields that themselves greatly influenced Freud. This course will address fundamental concepts of Freudian and Lacanian psychoanalyses (such as the unconscious, repression, transference, and drives), explore various affinities between psychoanalytic and literary insights into the human psyche and culture, and consider the ways in which the two fields can illuminate each other. Readings will include selections from Freud\u2019s seminal texts, as well as writings by Jacques Lacan, St. Augustine, Shakespeare, Virginia Woolf, Isak Dinesen, Marguerite Duras, Xavier Marias, and W. G. Sebald, among others. ",

This course attempts to recover an unfiltered view of Shakespeare\u2019s works by performing close readings grounded in an attention to their historical conditions. We will learn how Shakespeare\u2019s writings are embedded in theatrical and literary traditions, and how they fit into a context undergoing tremendous social, political, artistic, and intellectual upheaval. Through careful investigations of Shakespeare\u2019s techniques, we will also discover how his writings engage philosophical and social issues relating to politics, sexuality, gender, and race that remain pressing today. While our primary aim will be to cultivate our close-reading skills, we will also draw on philosophical texts, theater history, film, and performance work. In addition to the sonnets, we will read representative plays that span Shakespeare\u2019s career, including Richard III, Love's Labour's Lost, Henry IV pt. 1, Macbeth, As You Like It, Othello, and Cymbeline.

Using as our focal point Max Nordau\u2019s 1892 bestseller Degeneration, which argued that contemporary artists like Oscar Wilde, Emile Zola, Richard Wagner, Henrik Ibsen and Friedrich Nietzsche were clinically insane, we will explore the prevalent late nineteenth-century identification of new literary forms with madness, criminality and perversion; we will also try to understand why the themes of disease, degeneration and cultural decline fascinated the very artists whom Nordau attacked, and inspired some of their greatest works.

The period from the Restoration of the English monarchy in 1660 through the French Revolution tends to be treated as a period of progress in Britain and Europe. It has been called the Age of Revolutions, referring to dramatic changes in politics, science, and political economy that produced new views of factuality related to scientific discoveries and mechanical inventions. However, this course explores the premise that new forms of fictionality equally characterized the emergence of modern civil society. From the scientific hypothesis, to historical conjecture, to economic prognostication, to the national lottery and other games of chance, eighteenth-century British society witnessed the proliferation of many forms of make-believe. By gathering together discussions of these different forms, this course will challenge the typical division between imaginative and scientific types of supposition. Readings will include works by Margaret Cavendish, Isaac Newton, Eliza Haywood, Daniel Defoe, Horace Walpole, Laurence Sterne, Adam Smith, Maria Edgeworth, and Jane Austen.

If literary theory rigorously questions things we take to be common sense -- what precisely do we mean when we talk about \"authors\" and \"texts,\" for instance? -- it also provides a space for the critical, creative linking of the literary to the social. How has colonialism shaped our ideas of the novel? What is the relationship between theories of intention and the performance of gender? And how do questions of racial difference intersect with models of narrative voice? We will read works that tackle these issues (and more) by theorists including Walter Benjamin, Judith Butler, Barbara Johnson, Henry Louis Gates Jr., Edward Said, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, Gayatri\nSpivak, and Raymond Williams.

This course explores the myriad ways that Victorian writers, thinkers, politicians, and artists responded to seemingly timeless but persistently present poverty and its effect on the \"Condition of England.\" Focusing on texts as disparate as economic theory, aesthetic theory, the novel, and poetry and the rich tradition of nineteenth-century visual culture, particularly reproducible prints, oil paintings in both the English School and the Pre-Raphaelites, and nascent photography, this class aims to demonstrate how questions about and responses to poverty vary by discipline and media but also cut across them. To what extent is poverty an ethical, social, economic, political, or aesthetic problem? In centralizing social and economic class as the primary register of difference, we will think intersectionally about how poverty in nineteenth-century Britain attaches to certain marked bodies. Texts and paintings might includes those by: Charles Dickens, Thomas Carlyle, John Ruskin, John Stuart Mill, Henry Fawcett, Friedrich Engels, Henry Mayhew, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Elizabeth Gaskell, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, William Morris, John Everett Millais, Ford Madox Brown, David Wilkie, William Holman Hunt, Richard Beard, and others.

        "department": "litseminar",
        "description": "Cross-listed: French Studies The Useful, Schiller wrote in The Aesthetic Education of Man, is the great idol of our age. It divorces leisure from labor and turns life into a series of utilitarian dead ends. Conversely, the impulse to play, to engage in gratuitous moments of being, in seemingly evanescent conversations, might be our only chance to convert specialized knowledge into self-knowledge. Since Socrates, conversation has been admired for its seamless ability to perform thinking, to integrate knowledge into society, and to supplement savoir (knowledge) with savoir-vivre (the art of living). But conversation, precisely because it clashes with the useful, has often been condemned as merely artful, dangerous for its proximity to the decadent and the idle. But what is so threatening about idleness? According to Nietzsche, because idleness leads to self-reflection, we avoid it by mindlessly embracing work. The work ethic has become an excuse for not thinking about the desperate human condition. Paradoxically, work has become an escapist diversion and the time to rest and to converse has been usurped by the false plenitude of mechanical labor. Proust\u2019s In Search of Lost Time adds a new twist to this dichotomy: for the social climber, conversation becomes work, a laborious exercise in appearing rather than being. This course examines how these tensions are played both on a rhetorical (we will study the use of silences, repetition, dialogue, etc.) and on a thematic level. After reading a selection of critiques of \"pure\" work (Aristotle, Schiller, Marx, and Nietzsche), we will examine the resistance to work (Melville, Bartleby the Scrivener), the philosophical ramifications of laziness (Goncharov, Oblomov), the prejudice against conversation (Pascal\u2019s Pens\u00e9es, Moli\u00e8re\u2019s Misanthrope), the tension between work and conversation as social and cultural phenomena (Howells, The Rise of Silas Lapham) and instances where conversation becomes a mere filler (Woolf, To the Lighthouse, Chekhov, The Seagull).

        "description": "Cross-listed: Africana Studies; Human Rights; Latin American & Iberian Studies; Middle Eastern Studies This seminar considers how culture in the third world became a theater for Cold War, focusing on the 1950s-1970s. The course begins with the 1955 Bandung Conference and its call for Afro-Asian solidarity and non-alignment in the face of the either/or logic of Cold War. Aiming to curate a global \"non-Communist Left\" in its fight against Soviet cultural initiatives, the covertly CIA-founded and \u2013funded Congress for Cultural Freedom extended its efforts well beyond Europe after Bandung, beginning highly influential literary magazines, including Quest in India, Black Orpheus in Nigeria, Transition in Uganda, Hiwar in Lebanon, and several Latin American magazines, including the seminal Mundo Nuevo. The Soviets in turn built support for the Afro-Asian Writers Association, publishing their tri-lingual review of \"Afro-Asian writings\" \u2013 Lotus \u2013 from Cairo. In this course we will study the history of the Congress for Cultural Freedom and the Afro-Asian Writers Association after Bandung, reading selections from their Indian, Arab, African, and Latin American magazines, alongside theories of political commitment, decolonization, empire, liberalism, and Communism. Finally, the course will consider the context of cultural Cold War in the Caribbean, and the resurgent relevance of the Cold War to our own times, through a reading of Marlon James\u2019s recent novel A Brief History of Seven Killings.

Rather than study queer theory in a vacuum, this course will trace its antecedents in feminist methodologies and its continued life, particularly in the realms of disability theory and studies of embodiment more generally as well as within some of the most contested sites of literary theory. The course will focus on seminal texts in the field\u2014including but not limited to works by Michel Foucault, Georges Canguilhem, Judith Butler, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, Jack Halberstam, Lee Edelman, Michael Warner, Kobena Mercer, and Jos\u00e9 Esteban Mu\u00f1oz\u2014in conversation with a series of literary texts from the nineteenth- and twentieth-century Anglo-American tradition. This is a Junior Seminar, and as such we will devote substantial time to methods of research, writing, and revision. Your primary project will be an in-depth research project on a work(s) of literature using the theoretical terms explored over the course of the semester. Class size: 15",

It remains one of the greatest novels of the 20th century. This course uses the work and career of Ralph Ellison to explore critical issues in the fields of American and African American literature. The course also uses Ellison\u2019s Invisible Man as a structural roadmap in considering the literary, philosophical, and vernacular traditions that influenced its composition as well as Ellison\u2019s other writings. We will read Ellison\u2019s fiction and non-fiction (and that of his contemporaries, predecessors, critics, and scholars) in order to examine issues of race and ethnicity, gender, language, identity, and technique, and we will also consider questions regarding canon formation and archive-building.

When and why did this trope -- suggesting some vital flame snuffed out -- become key to how we talk about the realities of biological, cultural, and linguistic precarity? How does one narrate the end, not of an individual organism, but of a form of life? And what social or institutional histories influence the designation of a given group or tradition as \"vanishing\" or \"endangered\"? For answers to such questions, we will look to early works of natural history; to ethnographic and historical studies of populations on the edge; and to literary works, from Romantic-era poetry to science fiction, that investigate the links between ideas of species, culture, sexuality, media, religion, and violence -- and that sometimes propose speculative alternatives to the narrative of extinction.

Auden commanded his listeners, \"Thou shalt not sit / With statisticians nor commit / A social science.\" In an essay of 1962, James Baldwin wrote, \"I am far from being convinced that being released from the African witch doctor was worthwhile if I am now\u2014in order to support the moral contradictions and the spiritual aridity of my life\u2014expected to become dependent on the American psychiatrist.\" The twentieth century saw an enormous surge in the cultural prestige and moral authority of psychiatry, sociology, and anthropology. These disciplines, rather than religion or literature, established the principal vocabularies through which human identity and the prospects for social change were articulated. This course, which combines the study of American literature and American intellectual history, will explore the ways in which literature both appropriated and resisted this cultural transformation. We will ask questions such as: what is the relation between humanistic and social scientific knowledge? How does literature represent agency and desire, and do those representations track with social scientific accounts? Can certain emotional or spiritual states be explained by appeals to psychological structure or social forces? How might a literary anthropology evade the canons of psychiatric normalcy? How does the moral imagination respond when the language of good and evil is displaced by that of health, adjustment, and alienation? Writers considered in this course may include James Baldwin, W.H. Auden, Vladimir Nabokov, Richard Wright, Nathanael West, Flannery O\u2019Connor, Saul Bellow, Marilynne Robinson, Joseph Heller, Theodore Dreiser, and Mary McCarthy. Class size: 15",

In this course, students examine, from the ground up, the elements of that architecture by asking what, in the most concrete terms, makes a poem a dynamic, saturated language event. Rather than thinking of structure as an imposition, this workshop considers it an aid to the freeing of the imagination. Along the way, students encounter such aspects of poetic form as patterns of repetition; the infinite varieties of syntax, punctuation, meter, and typography; the \"color\" of vowels; and the rhythmic implications of word choice and sentence structure. Participants explore a range of techniques and materials from around the world and from the beginning of recorded history right up to the present moment. Writing for the course takes the form of creative responses to a wide variety of reading and weekly \"experiments.\" Class size: 14",

Over the course of the semester we will read from a broad range of classical and contemporary writers whose work is a deliberate hybrid of form, style, and genre. We will read essays that have the texture and imagination of a short story; stories that are closer to poems, journalists who use the tools common to fiction, and novelists whose work straddles the line between autobiography and fiction. Our reading for the semester will be based around broad, thematic concerns. We will discuss the relationship between form and content; the ethics of narration; and, ultimately, how we can apply the tools and techniques of the writers we\u2019ve read to our own creative and critical writing. This is a writing-intensive course. Students will be expected to write short, critical responses throughout the semester, as well as generate a substantial body of creative text. Class size: 14",

The purpose of the class is not to come up with a collective translation; rather, class discussions and independent research into the meanings of words inform participants enough about both French and English for them to arrive at their own individual translations of the poems. The class goes through the poems line by line, discussing the meanings of the words in the French originals and the boggling range of alternatives they present in English. The course functions as a writing workshop because learning to translate from a foreign language into English is writing at its most pure: it is the key to learning how to write resourcefully and powerfully, to knowing the weight and weft of words. Writing assignments are due every week and include both rigorous research into the French language and deep engagement with every writer\u2019s best friend, the O.E.D. Translation is supplemented by reading previous translations of Rimbaud as well as essays on translation\u2014not theoretical essays but writing on translation as a practice, a habit of mind. It is essential that students have both a passion for English usage and a background in the French language. ",

Emphasis is on demystifying the project process, including its bureaucratic hurdles, as well as exploring the role of research in the creative realm, and helping students use each other as a critical and inspirational resource during this protracted solitary endeavor, sharing works in progress when appropriate. This supplements but never supplants the primary and sacrosanct role of the project adviser. Program faculty and alumni/ae, career development and other staff, and outside speakers (such as editors, translators, MFA graduates and directors, publishing personnel, etc.) contribute their collective wisdom and experience, sharing the myriad ways in which writers move an idea toward full creative realization, and giving a glimpse of the kinds of internships and careers available to the writer.

Poetry itself, particularly when joined with music and dance by competing choruses, has established itself as its own kind of competitive event. This course will study the strange intersections of the physical, the social and the sacred we still recognize in sports. We will allot equal time to three different sets of readings: 1) case studies of the wedding of poetry to athletics in still thriving Oceanic cultures, from the Hawaiians to the Maori; 2) victory odes for the ancient Greek games, principally those of Pindar, praising victors in boxing, wrestling, running, pentathlon, pancratium (a.k.a Ultimate Fighting), chariot, and dithyramb; 3) sports poetry in Europe and the Americas, ranging from bullfighting and capoeira to ball games both in Classic Mesoamerica (Mayan and Aztec) and baseball poems in the 100 years. In all three parts we will not only study the poems themselves but also some scholarship by sports historians on the particular athletic events they reflect, and will view some video clips of the sports and poetry in action.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Literature From the Persian Empire, to Egypt and Ethiopia, to India, the literatures of the classical world were concerned with the representation of other peoples, places, and cultures. How did ancient writers think about difference? How do the ever-shifting boundaries of self and other shape the meaning of literature in antiquity? What is the relationship between structures of power and the literature of difference? In what ways can writing the world become a process of writing the self? This seminar will explore the invention of difference in antiquity in texts such as the Odyssey, Aeschylus\u2019 Persians and Suppliant Women, Euripides\u2019 Helen and Iphigenia among the Taurians, Herodotus\u2019 Histories, Aristophanes\u2019 Acharnians, Philostratus\u2019 Life of Apollonius, and Heliodorus\u2019 An Ethiopian Story. We will consider difference from several points of view: ethnicity, class, education, language, sexuality, and religious belief. We will also reflect on how our reading of ancient texts is informed by and can contribute to discussions of difference in other literatures and cultures, including our own. All readings will be in English translation. Class size: 16",

Russian culture represents an inseparable part of European cultural experience. And yet, it has a distinctly original character. Initially shaped by the Orthodox Christian tradition passed on from Byzantium, it eventually came into contact and conflict with the flow of West European ideas. It absorbed and confronted, transformed and blended the major creative achievements of the Old World with the unique Russian experience. Predictably, the history of Russian music followed that path. The early development of Russian music benefited from appropriation of the Byzantine unaccompanied choral singing and at the same time suffered from the absence of instrumental music. By comparison, the Western European music combined the use of vocal and instrumental faculties and resulted in the creation of numerous forms of musical art, including the most elaborate one: opera. The flourishing of this genre in Europe consequently had a direct impact on the progress of Russian musical culture. During the nineteenth century, opera became a powerful agent in Russia\u2019s search for national identity. The list of operas includes such masterpieces as A Life for the Tsar by Glinka, Boris Godunov and Khovanshchina by Mussorgsky, The Tsar's Bride by Rimsky-Korsakov, The Queen of Spades and Eugene Onegin by Tchaikovsky, War and Peace by Prokofiev, and Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk by Shostakovich. The assigned material will also include selected literary texts as well as video and audio recordings. You will also have a chance to attend a live performance of a Russian opera at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. No training in music is required. Conducted in English. Class size: 15",

Through critical examinations of papers about agricultural science and laboratory explorations on plant physiology, growth, and defense, this course will equip you to evaluate evidence for the safety and efficacy of crop development and food production strategies.

It is intended for students with a strong interest in science and is appropriate for biology majors. The course will begin with an examination of heredity in both classical and modern molecular contexts. It will then focus on the relationships between genes and proteins, and the complex biochemical interactions that produce a phenotype. The course will culminate in a discussion of the ways in which the environment interacts with multiple genes to influence complex traits, for example schizophrenia, and the modern methods applied to the problem of identifying the genetic components of these traits. The laboratory will provide an opportunity to examine some of the principles discussed in the lecture in more detail and to become acquainted with some of the methodologies and instrumentation found in a modern biology laboratory.

Plants perform all the tasks we are familiar with from animal studies- acquiring energy, nutrients and water, growing and reproducing, sensing and responding to their environments- but the ways in which they do these tasks differ from animals. In this introductory course, we will examine the ways in which plants perform each of these tasks differently from animals. Topics include photosynthesis, cellular respiration, food webs, organism interactions and plant defenses. In the lab, you will explore the scientific process- reading and critiquing works by practicing scientists in the discipline to help you determine what is already known, asking questions, designing experiments, and reporting results. In the lab, you will perform field explorations of local ecosystems, explore antimicrobial properties of plant chemicals, and test hypotheses about plant-microbe interactions, and control of plant signaling and behavior.

Emphasis will be placed on the scientific method generally, and more specifically how it is applied to the process of ecological research. In so doing students will gain skills in: developing ecological questions; formulating testable hypotheses; designing experiments; collecting and analyzing data; and presenting results in both oral and written formats. These skills will be learned through a hands-on process in which students conduct a series of individual and collaborative field studies that test core hypotheses in the science of ecology, spanning multiple scales of inquiry and with special focus on Hudson Valley ecosystems. Students will be exposed to a broad spectrum of species (e.g. microbes, plants, insects, vertebrates) and ecosystem types (e.g. meadows, forests, streams) and the different methods used in their study. Field techniques will include time-budgets, point counts and transects of wild birds, line-transects of amphibians and plants, sweep-netting and pitfall trapping of insects, seine netting of fish, and acoustic sampling of insects and birds.

This course is primarily about the latter. In it, we seek answers to why organisms evolve various mating strategies, what accounts for differences in sexual characteristics and mate choice among males and females, how organisms use signals, the information they contain, whether they signal honest information or whether we expect to see cheaters within populations, conflicts of interest between siblings, parents and offspring, males and females, and so on. We explore these questions through lab and field experiments and using evolutionary game theory, which provides the underlying framework for understanding the evolution of animal behaviors. The lab portion of the class will allow you to learn new methods and technologies (e.g. bioacoustic recording and analysis, avian point counts and transects) useful in studying animal behavior, work individually and in groups to design experiments and models to test your own hypotheses. Research will focus on captive animals in Bard\u2019s laboratories, wild animals on Bard\u2019s campus and within the surrounding natural landscape, and on captive animals housed in a local zoo. As a capstone achievement, you will identify an important basic or applied question in animal behavior and write a professional National Science Foundation-style proposal advocating for the funding of a research project of your own design.

What constitutes a game? Why do people play them? What makes digital gamesdifferent from non-digital games? What roles do games play in contemporary culture? How have game-like incentive systems and other forms of \"gamification\" infused non-game contexts, such as socialmedia, fine art, democracy, education, war, and the modern workplace? Do games and \"gamer\" cultureeffectively preclude, privilege, include, or exclude certain groups, identities, and worldviews? Coursereadings, screenings, and mandatory game play will augment and inform our investigation of thesequestions and beyond. The primary coursework will consist of game creation using tools and methodologies from computerscience and electronic art. Students will create original games (non-digital and digital video games), bothindependently and in groups. This work will be augmented by short assignments designed to buildfluency in visual art creation and interactive game design through short exercises in coding in Javascript,visual design applications, and Unity, a game design application. Assignments will push students todevelop experimental and critical approaches to game creation. This course is restricted to students in the lower college. Students with little experience playing games and/or a healthy skepticism about the cultural and artisticvalue of games are encouraged to apply.

To explore some of quantum mechanic\u2019s most interesting phenomena, including contextuality, entanglement, and nonlocality, we will next study systems of qubits. After an interlude on the interpretation of quantum mechanics, we will consider a variety of applications of quantum mechanics: 1-dimensional systems, including the harmonic oscillator, 3-dimensional systems, including the hydrogen atom, and quantum statistical mechanics, including that of identical particles as well as scattering and perturbation theory. We will conclude by learning the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics. Time permitting, we will touch on such topics as decoherence and quantum computation.

        "department": "psychology",
        "description": "Cross-listed: Human Rights; Social Studies It has now been more than fifty years since the original work of Stanley Milgram demonstrated the remarkable and very widely unpredicted and unexpected finding that large numbers of individuals in multiple samples of American men and women studied were willing to \"punish\" another person when ordered to do so by an experimenter; this in the stated but false context of a psychology experiment on learning and memory. The prominence of the initial work and the continued salience of such study and accumulated findings in the domain of social psychology cannot be over-stated. And it very much has not reached the stage of dormancy as the publication of studies, literature reviews and conferences on the topic of obedience to authority continue to appear in unabated fashion. It is even the case that as recently as six years ago a replication of the original study, with slight modifications, and with concordant results was published (J. Burger, January 2009). Further revealing of prominence is that fact that a relatively new full-length movie version of the original study (a biopic) appeared this year. In addition, a diligent search of current psychology or cross-disciplinary archives uncovers further studies that provide evidence that obedience and indeed destructive obedience is very much prevalent in our society and in many others as well and in a myriad of contexts. The domain of the \"Milgram study\" is especially worthy of continuing interest. This because of the vastness of both criticism and praise of the original work but also because of historical and significant events in the intervening years between 1960s and stretching to our current time. The continuing study of obedience is vital for the betterment of institutions, even in a democratic society. Social scientists should and must find a way to safely and ethically investigate the conditions that promote destructive obedience and thereby begin to learn the rudiments of how such can be minimized. This is a college seminar. It is not limited to psychology or social studies or for that matter majors in any particular discipline. The two criteria for membership are a willingness to read with care and then with conviction share with others the results of such reading and study. Over the course of the semester a sizable portion of the work contained in the body of the obedience literature is reviewed. Admission by permission of the instructor. Class size: 10",

Kennedy captured a truth about human decision-making when he noted that \"the essence of ultimate decision remains impenetrable to the observer - often, indeed to the decider himself.\" In this course, we will heed Kennedy's reminder that conscious reflection and verbal report often lead to inaccurate descriptions of the causes of our judgments and decisions. Our focus will be on trying to ascertain the underlying causes of these mental processes by relying on contemporary research in fields such as psychology, neuroscience, economics, political science that offer the systematic study of how people make decisions given limited time and vast uncertainty. Sources will include empirical articles as well as review papers, videos, and case studies.

We will begin with the history of these ideas but place a special focus on the empirical research of the past 40 years. After reading work in cognitive psychology that introduces us to foundational concepts such as implicit learning, memory, and perception (i.e., subliminal perception), we will spend the bulk of our time engaging with how these processes unfold in our social worlds (e.g., attitudes, prejudices, emotions, goals, self-esteem, and relationships). We will conclude by considering the implications of this research for notions of free will and individual responsibility.

This course will trace the history of the \u2018culture concept\u2019 from the nineteenth century to the present. In doing so, it will explore anthropological approaches to \u2018primitive\u2019 societies, group and personal symbols, and systems of exchange. It will examine how anthropology came to focus on questions of identity, race, gender, sexuality, nationalism, colonial and post-colonial conditions. Our ethnographic gaze will be turned inward as well as outward. We will therefore consider the reasons behind, and ramifications of, anthropology\u2019s self-reflexive turn in and around the 1980s. We will juxtapose that turn\u2019s questioning of the discipline\u2019s authority to represent other societies with debates about anthropologists\u2019 engagement in activism, policy and government (e.g. the US military\u2019s Human Terrain project). We will then examine the more recent anthropological fascination with the non-human (e.g. other animals, technology, the built environment, \u2018nature\u2019), looking at how notions of agency, materiality, and anthropology\u2019s own methodological foundations have been transformed as a result.

Dinosaurs appear everywhere\u2014as plush toys and chicken nuggets, as corporate mascots and public monuments, and as metaphorical critiques of nuclear weapons. In this course, we will explore the figure of the modern dinosaur both as object of scientific inquiry and as popular culture icon. We will focus on competitive exploration for dinosaur fossils at the turn of the 20th century; rivalries between paleontologists such as Edward Drinker Cope and Othniel Charles Marsh; and the rise of dinosaur philanthropy in natural history museums. We will also consider how new paleontological discoveries provoked parallel shifts in meaning and representation. How are dinosaurs articulated and brought back to life from a distant geologic past? How are they employed as metaphors for dominance, size, dim-wittedness, and obsolescence? What role do they play in the making of power and nationhood? Through the close examination of scientific and cultural histories, museums, and popular media, this course will address our fascination with dinosaurs, and how the reemergence of these prehistoric creatures helped shape our modern world.Class size: 22",

We do not conceive of methods as simply a means to an end, or the application of established techniques for generating answers to prior problems developed in anthropological theory. Rather, students will be encouraged to think about the types of data that various ethnographic techniques can produce, the epistemological and theoretical assumptions embedded in them, and, most importantly, the ways different strategies for data collection can be combined to form an anthropological research project. To that end, students will develop and execute a short fieldwork-based anthropological research project over the course of the semester. Readings and discussions will guide students through the process of developing research questions, choosing a field site, generating data, and re-presenting that field site in writing. To complement the fieldwork projects, we will also read exemplary \u2013 and sometimes controversial - texts of ethnography in practice. Class size: 18",

Examining law breaking in the 21st century provides a lens through which to work through the meanings of states, citizenship, and identity. In this context, we ask: What constitutes criminal activity and who decides the answer to this question? How and when does crime threaten the state? What is the relationship between the violence of state and non-state actors? How can we rethink globalization through the lens of criminal activity? Readings will examine the experience of crime in post-Civil War San Salvador, criminality resulting from the securitization of the U.S.-Mexico border, the mirroring of criminal and state enterprises in Brazil, and surveillance technologies in Mexico City.",

The emphasis is on questions of strategy and organization and how these relate to wider ethical and philosophical issues. What were the challenges that campaigners faced? How did they resolve them? What alliances of interest did they confront? And what coalitions did they form to combat them? The course also considers the questions that emerge from consideration of these campaigns: how have human rights campaigners have engaged with\u2014and been part of\u2014wider political, religious and economic changes? Have the successes of the human rights movement\u2014particularly the expansion of international human rights legislation\u2014changed its character? When, if ever, are indigenous values more important than universal principles? What is the relation of human rights to religious values? Is human rights itself a quasi-religious belief system? Or just a political language? Finally the course considers the question of animal rights and the challenges this poses for the concept of rights and the extent of proper moral concern.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Africana Studies; Global & International Studies; Literature Anthropological writing is diverse and innovative in both style and subject. Although \"ethnography\" and \"fieldwork\" are terms that have become widely used in other disciplines, writers identifying themselves as anthropologists are still at the cutting edge of research-based factual writing, usually about small-scale societies, both those on the periphery of the world system and those at the heart of it. The course examines the range of genres and techniques that anthropologists and others have used to convey the lived experience of other cultures. It examines the tension within the discipline between making these cultures comprehensible, respecting their difference and rendering them in a framework of theory. And it considers the aesthetic problems and ethical controversies that arise from writing at the limits of academic discourse. The genres addressed include classic field-based ethnographic monographs, travel narratives, historically-informed indigenous critiques of earlier ethnographies, reflexive accounts of the process of field work, journalistic reportage, visual documentation and works of fiction. The course takes the form of close readings of outstanding examples, drawn mainly from the anthropology of Africa and Latin America. These are set in context by accounts from other media. Texts to be studied will be drawn from the following: Bronislaw Malinowski A Diary in the Strict Sense of the Term; Claude Levi-Strauss Tristes Tropiques; Oscar Lewis The Children of Sanchez; Ruth Landes City of Women; Sharon Hutchinson Nuer Dilemmas; Carlos Castaneda\u2019 Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledge; Adam Ashforth Madumo; Don Kulick Travest\u00ed; Michael Taussig My Cocaine Museum; Leni Riefenstahl The Last of the Nuba; V.S.Naipaul A House for Mr Biswas; Katherine Boo Behind The Beautiful Forevers; Charles Doughty Travels in Arabia Deserta and Alma Guillermoprieto Samba.

Required of all anthropology majors, this course will also be of interest to students wishing to explore critical innovations in the study of local, national, and mass culture around the world. In contrast to early anthropological focus on seemingly isolated, holistic cultures, more recent studies have turned their attention to contest within societies and the intersection of local systems of meaning with global processes of politics, economics and history. The class will be designed around an influential social theorist, such as Bourdieu, Bakhtin, or Marx, and the application of their theories by anthropologists, such as Aihwa Ong, Judith Irvine, or Michael Taussig. The seminar will involve participation from all of the faculty in the anthropology department. It aims to inspire critical engagement with an eye towards developing theoretical tools and questions for a senior project that makes use of contemporary theories of culture.

In it, students will get acquainted with main models that macroeconomists use to analyze the way economies behave. The course starts by looking at the models that explain long run economic growth. We then focus our attention on investigating economic theories that explain short run business cycles, the periods of recessions and booms that occur on a regular basis. An important part of the course is to investigate the role of governments in affecting the long run and short run economic prospects of their countries. We apply the acquired theoretical knowledge to a range of current economic issues, including budget deficits and national debt, international trade, and the role of institutions.

While the discipline has come to be regarded as a core area of economics, its applicability extends far beyond the analysis of economic behavior. The object of this course is to introduce you to the basics of game theory, emphasizing its generality as an analytical paradigm for social science. We shall, therefore, focus on a wide variety of applications taken from economics, political science, and the study of the environment. Prerequisite: Econ 100 or Econ 101. Class size: 22",

The second part of the class is devoted to post-WWII Europe: reconstruction, the golden age, communism / socialism, the 80s turn around, Maastricht and the Euro, and the European crisis. The questions addressed include: What lessons does the Roman Empire teach us? What was the role of agriculture and urbanization in medieval Europe? Why did the Industrial Revolution take place in Britain, and not elsewhere? Why were some countries \"no-shows\", or very slow, to join the development bandwagon? What are the economic motivations, and consequences, of wars? How do institutions and government interventions frame economic growth? How important is international trade for Europe? What opportunities and challenges do natural resources (or lack thereof) pose? How did the European Union and the Eurozone come to be? Can present-day Europe overcome its challenges? The course is designed for inquiring minds who wish to understand how Europe came to be the major economic area it is now. Our approach is interdisciplinary (history, sociology, politics, geography, institutions\u2026); however we will insist on their economic aspect. Class size: 22",

The rest of the course is divided into three parts: the first part explores several key manifestations of development such as economic growth, industrialization, urbanization, globalization, inequality and poverty; the second part examines institutional determinants of development, including markets, political systems and culture; the third part deals with policies designed to address specific development goals, such as providing education, promoting gender equity or expanding access to financial markets. Classroom discussions will be supplemented by several book reports and discussions on popular contemporary books on development, and a semester-long case study each student will carry out on development experiences of a country of their choice.

Since Adam Smith, economists have used different assumptions, models and methodologies to study the role of markets, states, and institutions in the process of social provisioning. This course will survey the diverse traditions in economics and introduce students to competing paradigms. It covers several distinct approaches including Classical Political Economy, Neoclassical, Institutionalist, Post Keynesian, Marxist, Feminist, Development and Green Economics. The objective is to gain a broad appreciation of the specific problems that each of these traditions emphasizes and the contributions to theory and policy each has made. Students will examine not only the evolution of ideas and theories, but also their practical application today. Some of the specific issues that the course will consider include the causes and cures for unemployment, the evolution and interaction of culture, technology and the environment, and the role and nature of money in shaping the modern world. As we contemplate modern economic problems, sometimes the good old ideas produce the best new ideas. Prerequisite: Econ 100. Class size: 20",

Its research agenda reaches broadly into diverse aspects of economic and social theory. As a practical philosophy, geoclassical thought has roots in ancient Arabic and Hebrew traditions. As an analytical system, it emerged during the 17th through the 19th centuries in the political economy of John Locke, Fran\u00e7ois Quesnay, Adam Smith, David Ricardo, John Stuart Mill, and Henry George. We review the classic and contemporary literature of geoclassical economics and explore its relationship to other schools of economic thought\u2014neoclassical, ecological, and institutional. We also examine applications to both contemporary and enduring social problems, including: the Great Recession of 2008; rising inequality; crushing private and public debt burdens; distortionary taxes and subsidies; ecological destruction, urban blight, and suburban sprawl; and territorial disputes.

The stories on the news are almost always connected with people, whether we observe them shouting bids in a trading floor or talking on two phones simultaneously. Financial markets are dominated by people behaving in many different ways. Yet traditional finance theories concentrate on efficient markets, predictable prices that are determined by the concepts of present value, rates of return and analysis and pricing of computable risks. Human behavior has neither a place in the theory nor a need to be studied. This prevailing view has recently been challenged by the new paradigm of behavioral finance that considers the many anomalies of \"rational\" behavior and \"efficiency\" of markets. The new paradigm concerns itself with economic decision-making and investor psychology, and specifically with questions relating to how and why people exhibit a mixture of rational and irrational behavior. The seminar will examine the influence of economic psychology in the decision-making process of various agents as well as in the market's dynamics. Several guest lecturers will also offer their informed views in the development of contemporary finance. Class size: 15",

At the same time, historian Craig Wilder's EBONY AND IVY (2013), linking elite American institutions to slavery, Brown University's disclosures of the fortune made in the transAtlantic slave trade by its founders, and the recent acknowledgement by Georgetown University of its sale of slaves to pay off antebellum debts are just a few examples of the ways in which the role played by institutions of higher learning in reproducing racial and other social hierarchies in the United States has been proven. How have these contradictory dynamics manifested themselves at Bard College? In this Engaged Liberal Arts and Sciences (ELAS) course, we will explore this question by reviewing the College's evolving admissions policies toward blacks and the experiences of alumni of color at the College, and after graduation over time. Social profile, oral history, and mapping methodologies will be utilized. While the focus will be primarily on African Americans, we will also consider the history of similar student populations at the College. Class size: 22",

How did the revolutionary generation square their call for liberty and freedom with their dependence on slavery? Was John Brown a martyr and hero, or simply \"unbalanced to the verge of outright madness\"? Were Sacco and Vanzetti robbers and murderers or the victims of a political prosecution?

Although dating back in its modern form to only the sixteenth century, the concept of the experiment as an attempt to find underlying continuities in experience has numerous origins stretching back to earliest recorded history. In this course, we will examine how different experiments and artisanal practices have been used to interpret the natural world, and how those interpretations are reflective of the time periods and cultural contexts in which they were made. We will conduct our own experiments in replicability, discuss performance and the public culture of science, and explore the visual and material cultures of science. This course is required for those who wish to concentrate in Experimental Humanities. Class size: 20",

The course will take a long view of the origins, growth and expansion of the medieval kingdoms of Ghana, Mali, and Songhai; and study the Hausa states, Yoruba chiefdoms, and the republican communities and city-states of the Igbo people, among others. Topics discussed will include social and political organization of West African societies; bureaucratic and government institutions, economy and trade, education and scholarship; military organization and warfare of states in the region. Salient features and transformations in traditional West African religion and modes of worship will be studied both in relation to their internal dynamics, and in the encounter of conflict and negotiation with Islam and Christianity. The extent to which trans-Saharan and trans-Atlantic commercial networks served to facilitate the exchange of economic, cultural and intellectual products and services with North Africa, the Mediterranean, Europe and the New World will be analyzed. The history of domestic slavery in West Africa and of the traffic of West African captives in the Atlantic World will be examined in the context of global developments. The character and progression of West African imperialism, sometimes actuated by territorial annexation or control, and sometimes by the propagation of Jihadist programs, will be studied side-by-side with the aspirations of European imperialism in the region as a precursor to the establishment of the Colonial State.

The course emphasizes the interaction between society, culture, and politics. Therefore, in addressing each of these broad themes, we will pay particular attention to their social and cultural aspects such as gender, labor, popular culture, and forms of protest. In addition to exploring modern Middle Eastern history, students will acquire critical thinking skills through examining primary documents and reflecting on the uses of history in contemporary contexts.",

Wells, daughter of two American slaves. Her campaign against lynching in the late 19th- and early 20th-century continues to complicate understandings of how and why black bodies are raced. She exposes lynching as state-sanctioned, extra-legal violence against black men and women. She challenges the legal double standards that erase the victimization of black women and the sexual agency of white women. In doing so, she put her life and livelihood on the line. In Wells\u2019 work, we see the matrix of more than a century of black feminist thought, critical race theory, and civil and human rights activism. With articles on New Orleans and East Saint Louis that address violence against the police as well as police use of excessive force, her work speaks urgently of the contemporary American predicament to which the Black Lives Matters movement responds.

This course questions whether this articulation of the United States\u2019 presence in the Middle East fully reflects American interests in the region. It also explores how US policy has oscillated between disengagement and intervention. Drawing on various sources such as government documents, consular reports, and propaganda posters, we will critically engage with these questions and unpack the features of US involvement in the Middle East from its beginnings in the late Ottoman Empire to modern day Iraq and Afghanistan. Alternative sources, such as popular slogans, songs, cartoons, and film, will allow us to explore Middle Eastern responses (both positive and negative) to American presence in the region. Topics include humanitarianism, imperialism, popular protest, revolution, and the appeal of American popular culture.",

We will approach these issues with the goal of understanding how certain portrayals facilitated Western imperialism toward China, even as imperialism generated the social, cultural, and political contexts in which those portrayals were produced. We will also explore how changing relations between the People\u2019s Republic of China and the Euro-American world during the past three decades have generated new images of China, even as images from earlier periods continue to shape popular conceptions. Shared readings in theoretical literature discussing Orientalism, cross-cultural observation, and the politics of modernization theory will provide a common framework for our work. We will analyze representations of China in a wide array of sources, including popular histories, news reports, travel writing, academic works, novels, photographic essays, documentary and feature films, websites, blogs, and list-serves.

The final third of the course will focus on contemporary China in light of the history of the period of Reform and Opening (1978-present), since Mao\u2019s death.

Captivity in the early modern world engages questions of war and ransom as much as labor, religion, and race. It involves contracts, written or not, for renting, selling, buying, and freeing people. As such, captivity figures prominently in the so-called laws of war and peace. The language of the law, here, indicates varying degrees of legitimacy and becomes a touchstone for the changing morality of societies--with profound consequences for understandings of gender and power. Students will write an Africa-centered paper based on primary research.\nThis course will serve as a Major Conference in historical research. Class size: 15",

Although the region is often considered a land of revolution, very few revolutions actually took place there in the twentieth century. Revolution and its possibility however had many unintended and traumatic consequences, including the rise of military regimes, state terrorism, and civil wars, with their attendant human rights abuses. This seminar begins with a study of the two major revolutions in the first half of the twentieth century, in Mexico and Cuba. It then focuses on the repressive reaction to the possibility or imagination of revolution elsewhere in the region, in much of Central and South America, in the latter part of the century. By studying twentieth-century Latin America from the perspective of both revolution and repression, the seminar allows for a more complete understanding of the region\u2019s recent human rights crisis and its legacy of trauma, both of which matter greatly to the region today.

        "description": "The major writing assignment in this course is an extended research paper on a topic of the student\u2019s choice, usually based heavily on documents from the relevant period. Class readings will consist of both primary source documents as well as the work of historians and social scientists. This course will touch on the entire range of American immigration history but it focuses on the period since 1870. Among the major topics to be considered this semester are 1) The great policy debates over restricting immigration. After decades of national debate, Congress finally ended mass immigration altogether in 1924; but another four decades of national debate led Congress to sweep away the 1924 law, leading to a new mass immigration, this time from the countries of Asia and Latin America. What generated these massive shifts in American thinking, ideals and resultant demographics? What role did international as well as U.S. political dynamics play in each of these shifts? 2) Mexican immigration to the US has been distinctive in several ways. It has continued over a very long period (well over a century); in the late 19th and early 20th centuries Mexicans came to have a unique place in the racial hierarchy of the Southwest; in recent decades, the sheer scale of the Mexican immigration and the presence of so many undocumented people in it have also been unique. How have all these features affected these immigrants and the larger society? Enrollment Limited to 12. This course fulfills the History Program requirement for a Major Conference. Class size: 12",

This course introduces major approaches to three such questions: How do we know what we know? What sorts of things exist? What sorts of things are we? Our emphasis will be on the (often conflicting) answers philosophers have given to these questions, but at least one other question about our endeavor will also be at issue: Is there a right and a wrong way to go about answering these questions \u2013 and who has the authority to decide? Readings will include classical formulations of and answers to these questions as well as contemporary versions and responses to them.",

An ancient tradition claims that we have a detailed set of inborn capabilities and limitations, rich in implications for how we can live our lives and organize society. An opposing tradition emphasizes plasticity and indeterminacy; at the limit, it pictures us as \"blank slates,\" ready to form ourselves or to be formed by society. What remains of this debate once we refine the claims of each side? If there is a human nature, what is it, who can speak with authority about it, and what implications does it have for changing what we are? If there isn\u2019t a human nature, does this more freely license the genetic and technological development of what we are? We will investigate these and other questions in the course through an interdisciplinary mix of readings from philosophy, psychology, evolutionary biology, and other fields. Class size: 22",

From there, we will turn to broader topics that cut across various art forms: Are serious (or \"high\") and popular (or \"low\") art to be understood and evaluated differently? How do we evaluate works of art, and why do we so often disagree on their value? And what, if anything, do the various items and activities that we classify as \"art\" have in common?

We will also screen a number of films and videos, including the Anita Hill/Clarence Thomas hearings, Madonna's \"Truth or Dare,\" and documentaries on the pre-Stonewall femme-butch bar-scene culture of the 1950s and 60s, anorexia, rape on campus, the pornographic film industry, and several others.

The course will aim at doing philosophy and not only knowing philosophers. This distinction is important as areas with a legacy of epistemological colonialism, like the Caribbean, have many works that contain a substratum of philosophical ideas but have not necessarily been welcomed as canonical works of philosophy. Thus we will seek to engage in philosophy as a questioning activity that attempts to answer epistemic, aesthetic, normative and metaphysical questions. Some threads of analysis unique to this geography that this course will cover, include: the idea that philosophy is a contextual project rooted in a specific place rather than an abstract, ideal theory; the effect of colonialism on culture and education; the exploration of creolization; and the critical analysis of \"modernity\" as a European project. Course texts include works by Edouard Glissant, Wilson Harris, Eugenio Maria Hostos, Julia de Burgos and Franz Fanon.

Moving from the tradition of 19th century German critical thought through the birth of Poststructuralism and the 68\u2019 moment, this course traces the transformation of radical political thought from a theoretical discourse centered on Neo-Marxist critiques of social, political, and economic institutions to a form of politics centered on freedom, justice, and individualism. We begin the class with an examination of alienation, reification, and the call to revolutionary class-consciousness in the works of Marx and Luk\u00e1cs. These concepts provide a theoretical foundation for the tradition of critical theory that emerged from the so-called Frankfurt School in the works of Marcuse, Horkheimer, Adorno, and Benjamin. Alongside these thinkers we will examine post-industrial society, enlightenment reasoning, and critiques of power. Transitioning to the emergence of Poststructuralist thought, we will look at some of the conceptual differences between Adorno\u2019s/Horkheimer\u2019s and Foucault\u2019s critique/s of reason.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Gender & Sexuality Studies; Global & International Studies (core course); Human Rights This course will introduce students to major theories and issues concerning gender and international security affairs. We will begin by examining the interdisciplinary literature on gender theory and applying its insights to international politics. What does it mean to conduct a \"gendered analysis\" of global affairs? How do gendered discourses produce our understanding of what is and is not understood as a national security problem? Why has traditional security studies failed to incorporate gender into its analysis? Then, we apply these theoretical frameworks to important security issues such as,the cultural effects of nuclear weapons, the targeting of civilians during armed conflict, sexual violence in war, torture and the war on terrorism, nationalism and the state, human security and development, and post-conflict societies, to name a few. Throughout, the gendered nature of security issues will be explored from multi-disciplinary perspectives drawn from anthropology, sociology, philosophy, politics and rhetoric in order to highlight the complex interconnections among states, societies and individuals. Historical and contemporary case studies will be drawn from a number of countries across the globe. In reexamining key concepts in the study of international politics\u2014namely, sovereignty, the state and insecurity\u2014this course has two goals. First, to expose how gendered discourses of security that focus on the state render invisible a multitude of threats to individual security. Second, to question the role of the state as a security provider by highlighting the insecurities individuals and societies experience as a consequence of state-centered national security policy.

Our mission is two-fold: to explain the U.S.\u2019s behavior toward the nations of Latin America, especially a pronounced propensity toward intervention and interference in the politics of the region--from diplomatic snubs, to economic embargoes, to military occupations; and to understand how the Latin Americans have responded to America\u2019s policies. Beyond that, the course aims to provide a broad overview of the historical and ideological roots of the many conflicts that over the years have dominated U.S.-Latin American relations. The course is divided into three sections. The first one covers the years between 1821-1940, and emphasizes American military interventions in Latin America intended to establish economic and political hegemony across the region. The second section focuses on the dynamics of the Cold War, 1940-1990, and emphasizes the real and perceived fears by U.S. policy-makers about the advent of Marxist-inspired revolutions in Latin America, which led to military interventions and covert actions in Guatemala, the Dominican Republic, and Chile; and the high toll that the Cold War exacted upon Latin America. The third section looks at the most salient issues in U.S-L.A. relations in the post-Cold War years, especially economic integration, narco-trafficking, immigration, and the War on Terror.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Global & International Studies (core course); Human Rights (core course) When should states use military force to alleviate human suffering? Does the need to intervene to stop human rights violations outweigh the right of states to maintain control over territory? The international states system is built upon the principles of sovereignty and nonintervention. Yet over the past two decades human rights have emerged as an increasingly accepted justification legitimizing the use of force. This apparent tension between the respect for state sovereignty and the inevitable violations that result from the use of military force for humanitarian purposes is at the center of the debate over human rights in the field of international relations. This course explores the dilemmas and controversies surrounding the use of force for humanitarian purposes. The first part examines the major ethical, political and strategic arguments for and against humanitarian military intervention. The second part focuses on specific instances where states undertook, or failed to undertake, a humanitarian military intervention (for example, Bosnia, Somalia, Rwanda, Kosovo, Sudan, Libya and Syria, among others). Through an examination of particular case studies, we will better understand why the international community has such an inconsistent record of stopping humanitarian crises and what the limitations and possibilities of human rights are in international politics.

The first part of the semester looks at the history of the idea of constitutionalism in Ancient Greece, 18th century England, France, and the United States. The remainder of the semester will be devoted to a critical examination of the contemporary workings of constitutional law, focusing primarily on decisions of the highest courts of United States, India and South Africa relating to critical human rights issues. The course confronts core questions of the role of a constitution in the state and the particular challenges of a written constitution enforced by courts. By looking at constitutional enforcement comparatively, the course offers the opportunity to test theoretical assumptions and get beyond the US-centered approach that has dominated constitutional study for a variety of reasons (not least of which, the fact that the US has the longest and best established tradition of constitutional enforcement.) In addition to theoretical and historical readings, the course will include substantial case law readings. Students will also have the opportunity in their research to explore constitutional systems beyond South Africa, India and the United States. Beyond legal cases, readings include Aristotle, Montesquieu, Bodin, Arendt, and the Federalist Papers. Class size: 40",

        "department": "politicalstudies",
        "description": "Cross-listed: Gender and Sexuality Studies; Global & International Studies; Human Rights Security is one of the foundational concepts in the study of international politics. As the principal rationale for war, the quest for security influences both states\u2019 behavior in the international system as well as the structure of state and society relations in domestic politics. Too often, however, the meaning of security is taken for granted in the study of international relations, with individuals, societies and states homogenized into one coherent model that focuses exclusively on the threat, use and control of military force. This seminar will interrogate this narrow concept of security by engaging with a diverse literature in international relations termed \"critical security studies.\" The critical security studies research agenda aims to denaturalize the common understandings of security that dominate the field of international relations and in doing so shows how security is socially constructed through specific and historically contingent political practices, which create shared social understandings and endow subjects with identities and interests. Some of the broad theoretical themes covered include how threats to security are defined and represented, gendered and feminist approaches to security, the emergence and effects of dominant discourses of security and the politics of threat construction. We will then apply the insights of the critical security studies approach to the contemporary security environment in the United States through a critical examination of the war on terrorism. The course ends with a discussion of the ethics of national security by looking at the politics of torture, human rights and the suspension of civil liberties in the state of exception.

Claims that the United States has been sheltered from the ideological contests of the rest of the world or that we are in a post-ideological era are receiving more scrutiny than ever. This class will seek to explore the idea that the United States has been substantially free of ideologies by examining different moments within U.S. political history and seeking to assess the coherence, influence, and origins of prevailing systems of ideas. Beginning with Jeffersonian republicanism and taking in Antebellum slavery, Abolitionism, Progressivism, Cold War Neo-conservatism, and Neo-liberalism (amongst others), the class will consider whether any of these impulses amount to an ideology and what, if any, legacy they left for subsequent American political thought. In the final classes of the semester we will critically consider the 2016 election cycle as evidence of a renewal of ideological impulses in the United States. Alongside primary documents from the relevant periods, the class will study secondary analyses of the periods in question and broader considerations of the concept of ideology. Participants will be required to design and carry out a research project related to the topic of the class over the course of the semester. Class size: 16",

Notwithstanding the common (mis)perception of a single Jewish ethnicity, Judaism presents humanists with a fascinating test-case of a distinct, even parochial tradition that constantly takes up new shape and color while, arguably, maintaining a \"family resemblance\" with parallel expressions of Judaism. This course introduces students to the many foundational practices, ideas, and expressions of Judaism while grappling both with its inner diversity, as well as its sense of dissimilarity from surrounding non-Jewish communities. We will emphasize the formative history of rabbinic Judaism in ancient and medieval times, and then consider the development, in modern times, of new traditions out of that Judaism, including Hassidism, the Haskala (Jewish Enlightenment), modern European and American denominations (Reform, Orthodox, Conservative et al), Zionism, and contemporary \"cultural\" Judaism.

Along with engaging with the different genres and imaginative worlds these works present, this course considers relevant theoretical issues of canon, intertextuality, and asks whether we can or should conceive of a Jewish textuality. Works / authors studied include: biblical books (Exodus, Isaiah, Psalms), rabbinic texts (Talmud, Midrash), Jewish philosophy (Maimonides\u2019 Guide of the Perplexed), Iberian Jewish poetry (Ibn Gabirol, A. Ibn Ezra, Judah ha-Levi), Kabbalah (Zohar, Lurianic Mysticism), Hassidic homilies and stories (Levi Yitzhak of Berditchev, Nahman of Bretslav), works of the Jewish Enlightenment (Autobiography of Salomon Maimon), Political Manifestos (Herzl\u2019s Old-New Land), Holocaust (Primo Levi), Modern Fiction (I.

The topic of equality reaches into every area of human culture: local politics, national identity, international relations; political science, philosophy, jurisprudence, and literature; religious institutions; the military profession; economics, psychology, sociology, and history. Problems focused on equality have broad dimensions of theory and practice, contrasting what should be and what can be with what is. The examination of what equality means in these different areas holds up a mirror to ourselves. The project includes parallel seminar courses at both institutions using common reading material prepared by Bard and West Point faculty; four joint sessions that bring together the students and faculty collaborating in the project; an academic conference hosted by Bard College at which invited scholarly papers are presented and discussed. This course is part of the Courage To Be College Seminar Series; students are required to attend three lectures in the in Courage to Be Lecture Series sponsored by the Hannah Arendt Center.

        "department": "religion",
        "description": "Cross-listed: Gender & Sexuality Studies, Jewish Studies Traditional Judaism is often seen as a highly patriarchal system in which women have little access to public ritual roles or community leadership. It enforces a strict separation between men and women in many social situations, and prohibits even casual physical contact between husband and wife during the wife\u2019s menstrual period. It defines some sexual acts between two men as an \"abomination\" for which capital punishment is prescribed. What are the origins of these practices, and the social, theological, and psychological attitudes that they reflect? This course will examine a broad sweep of issues relating to gender and sexuality in the earliest strata of Jewish historical development, that is, the biblical and rabbinic periods. Topics to be covered will include public and private gender roles; power dynamics between men and women; views of sexuality, marriage and its variants; homosexuality; etc. We will read both narrative and legal primary texts, as well as current scholarship on the development of these issues in the ancient world. Our goal will be to gain an understanding of some of the beliefs and values that drove the development of early Judaism. Class size: 22",

While the Talmud was composed during a specific period (third to seventh centuries) and place (Sasanian Mesopotamia), it has been read and reread in many contexts since, from Baghdad to Brooklyn (to Bard). Each reading has engendered new texts worthy of study in their own right. Often classified as a work of law, it is perhaps best to describe the Talmud based on what it does: unrelenting, interpretive and intertextual weaving. This course will attempt to tackle the Talmud and talmudic process by closely reading a representative sample of talmudic passages, and then adopting lenses provided by a variety of humanistic disciplines, including philosophy, history, literature, anthropology, and even performance studies. All texts will be provided in translation. No prior background in Jewish Studies is required, though some experience in textual analysis / hermeneutics is important. Class size: 16",

The class also delves deeply into the theoretical and empirical debates about the punitive turn in American criminal justice over the last 4 decades.

And yet most children of Asian and Hispanic immigrants are also expected to be descendants of \u2018whites.\u2019 What criteria should be used to define the \u2018white\u2019 or \u2018nonwhite\u2019 status of these descendants -- and of the new majority? Specific topics include: the legacy of European ('white') immigrant and ethnic boundaries and their decline; institutional and cultural explanations for such decline; inter-faith marriages among Muslims, Jews, Catholics, etc.; Asian and Hispanic American patterns; the distinctive situation of African Americans; and the impact of all these upon our understanding of a new American majority.

Why does global inequality persist and why does a large share of the world\u2019s population continue to live in abject poverty, despite tremendous efforts made over the last half-century? Through the lens of specific topics, such as unequal impacts of environmental change, informal urban settlements and economies, and growing energy demands, this course examines such questions from two perspectives. First, we look at globalization and other structural forces that create and perpetuate global inequality. Second, we examine the goals and practices promoted by governments, development agencies, non-governmental organizations, and communities. This course will push students to think critically about the meanings and consequences of development, as well as about the challenges and possibilities we face in addressing some of the major social problems of our time.

While these accounts provide a sensational and superficial treatment of various social problems, what do researchers really know about the causes of and solutions for these problems? This course provides a critical survey and analysis of the varied social and structural factors that facilitate and help perpetuate social problems in the U.S. Topics include: schools and education; wealth and poverty; racial and ethnic inequality; teenage childbearing; residential segregation; immigration and mobility; gender inequality; work and socioeconomic attainment. The course will also provide framework for developing the skill of academic writing, and the appropriate use of theories, research questions and hypotheses. In particular, this seminar will serve social science majors and other advanced students who are developing their research and writing skills for term papers and senior projects.

This course gives students instruction in how to conduct this kind of qualitative research. It focuses on ethnography (participant observation), in-depth interviewing, and discursive/content analysis. The course is ideal for students from various majors who plan to use these methods for their senior project or those interested in pursuing social research in the future. It offers both conceptual grounding and practical training. This means the class engages epistemological questions about how we create knowledge and the nitty-gritty aspects of how to design and carry out a study. We will address debates about reflexivity, objectivity, power, and perspective in research. We will also learn various approaches to designing studies and drawing conclusions from qualitative data. The course offers training in research ethics and human subjects (IRB) review. In the class, students will develop and conduct a qualitative research project and learn practical techniques for taking field notes, conducting interviews, picking case studies, and interpreting and analyzing qualitative data.

        "department": "socstudies",
        "description": "Cross-listed: Human Rights; Social Studies It has now been more than fifty years since the original work of Stanley Milgram demonstrated the remarkable and very widely unpredicted and unexpected finding that large numbers of individuals in multiple samples of American men and women studied were willing to \"punish\" another person when ordered to do so by an experimenter; this in the stated but false context of a psychology experiment on learning and memory. The prominence of the initial work and the continued salience of such study and accumulated findings in the domain of social psychology cannot be over-stated. And it very much has not reached the stage of dormancy as the publication of studies, literature reviews and conferences on the topic of obedience to authority continue to appear in unabated fashion. It is even the case that as recently as six years ago a replication of the original study, with slight modifications, and with concordant results was published (J. Burger, January 2009). Further revealing of prominence is that fact that a relatively new full-length movie version of the original study (a biopic) appeared this year. In addition, a diligent search of current psychology or cross-disciplinary archives uncovers further studies that provide evidence that obedience and indeed destructive obedience is very much prevalent in our society and in many others as well and in a myriad of contexts. The domain of the \"Milgram study\" is especially worthy of continuing interest. This because of the vastness of both criticism and praise of the original work but also because of historical and significant events in the intervening years between 1960s and stretching to our current time. The continuing study of obedience is vital for the betterment of institutions, even in a democratic society. Social scientists should and must find a way to safely and ethically investigate the conditions that promote destructive obedience and thereby begin to learn the rudiments of how such can be minimized. This is a college seminar. It is not limited to psychology or social studies or for that matter majors in any particular discipline. The two criteria for membership are a willingness to read with care and then with conviction share with others the results of such reading and study. Over the course of the semester a sizable portion of the work contained in the body of the obedience literature is reviewed. Admission by permission of the instructor. Class size:\n10",

        "department": "bgia",
        "description": "Cross-listed: Environmental & Urban Studies; Global & International Studies Non-state actors have gained increasing importance in international affairs, and the expanded role of cities is often overlooked. Particularly in the post-9/11 era, cities are directly managing a wide variety of international issues and are hubs for the international movement of people, money and ideas. New York City is the ideal case study: city police are deployed overseas to monitor terrorist networks, financial institutions manage the global flow of trillions of dollars, the UN is the headquarters of international diplomacy, the city hosts a diverse mix of NGOs and major media, and New York is the destination for immigrants arriving from all corners of the world. This course explores the theoretical debates and practical policy effects of cities as non-state actors in international affairs. How should we define non-state actors? Where do cities fit in those debates? What strategies do different non-state actors use to influence national and global policy-making, with a particular focus on cities? In addition, the course contextualizes students\u2019 internship experiences within this broader discussion to critically examine how ideas about the role of non-state actors in world politics play out in practice. We will take advantage of our New York City location with guest speakers from a wide spectrum of organizations within the field, such as the United Nations, US State Department, New York Police Department, the Federal Reserve, Human Rights Watch, New York State Homeland Security, Council on Foreign Relations, World Policy Institute, Open Society Foundation, and many others.

From prehistoric cave drawings to spatial history digital projects, topics will include mapmaking traditions in Western Europe, ancient and medieval China, Islamic Central and South Asia, pre-contact America, as well as the intersection of these practices and the application of digital mapping within this history.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Experimental Humanities; Science, Technology, Society This class examines the relationship between theories of vision, and the production and reception of images, in European art and culture of the early modern period (ca. 1500-1750). During this time, ways of thinking about visual experience changed profoundly. The \"new science\" placed particular importance on observation, and a number of visual technologies (optical devices such as the camera obscura, telescope, microscope, and \"peepbox\") came into common use. At the same moment that ideas about visual experience were undergoing rapid change, older ways of thinking about vision (the experience of miraculous apparitions, and the dangers inherent in viewing seductive images, for instance) were still a part of everyday life. We will examine this complex moment thematically, considering topics such as: the historicity of vision; perspective systems and their distortion; deception and deceptive images (trompe l\u2019oeil); curiosity and connoisseurship; voyeurism; optical devices; visions of the divine; the image as evidence; the representation of sight. The class culminates in an exhibition, both online and on the Bard campus. Art History Distribution: Europe, 1400-1800. Class size: 22",

This class focuses on the commissioning of large-scale representational architecture, the creation of public space, and the orchestration of streets at seven sites in continuous use since antiquity. By charting the chronological development of these sites, the class examines the ongoing dialogue between the past and present in Rome. Requirements include critical essays, presentations, and tests. Completion of this class qualifies as a prerequisite for Roma in Situ (ARTH 248), taught during January in Rome and in the Spring at Bard. Open to all students.

This course will explore photography's history beyond the canon and beyond the standard Euro-American settings, in search of alternatives to conventional narratives. How, for example, has photography been appropriated and adapted by people who have more often been seen as the objects of the Euro-American gaze than wielders of the camera themselves? How can we read photographs by anonymous makers, or make sense of the inexhaustible reserves of vernacular photography? In addition to studying less familiar names and iterations of photography, we will also consider how canons are formed and why histories are constructed in particular ways. Our topics will touch on events and figures taken from the full 175-year sweep of photography's history. Class will take a lecture/discussion format; there will be substantial weekly reading, two exams and two papers. \nArt History Distribution: 1800-Present. Class size: 25",

Is it possible to create a new kind of dance product or new dance knowledge? What happens when we make work from a space of curious unknowing instead of confident knowing? In Comp III, we will investigate how we can reimagine the creative process in order to surprise ourselves with what it produces. We will draw from the movement-based ideas generated by philosophy, cultural studies, as well as dance makers past and present to generate our own processes and questions. We'll also explore the importance of working in other creative forms (such as visual arts and film) as a way to increase our understanding of our primary art form (dance, movement). Essential to our trajectory will be an increase in our dance literacy: our ability to see and speak about dance in its own milieu as well as understand its implications for and relevance to larger cultural contexts.

Through our exploration of the materiality and meaning of music, we will listen to wide-ranging examples of sounds from around the globe. We will consider ways to listen deeply and to write critically about music. We will examine how music has been represented in the past and how it is variously represented today, and will develop ethnographic research and writing skills. We will ask questions about the utility and value of music as a commodity in our everyday lives and in our globalized world. We will debate the ethics of musical appropriations and collaborations. We will examine both the foundational questions of the discipline (addressing debates about musical authenticity, musical origins, universals, comparative frameworks, and the preservationist ethos) as well as recent subjects of ethnomusicological concern. Topics will include: media and technology; post-colonial issues; music and language; hybridity; circulation and consumption; music and labor; music and gender; and the relevance of music to contemporary indigenous politics and human rights.

        "description": "In the 1920\u2019s, a number of new electronic instruments such as the Theremin, the Ondes Martenot, and the Trautonium were invented, and a number of composers, including Hindemith and Messiaen, composed new works for them. After the invention of magnetic recording tape in the late 40\u2019s electronic music became an enterprise that was produced in special studios and fixed on tape for later playback. Starting around 1960, John Cage and David Tudor began experimental performances with such works as Cartridge Music (1960), Variations II and other pieces that reintroduced the live performer to the electronic medium. Many composers, such as Mumma, Behrman, Lucier, Ashley, Stockhausen, Nono, and Boulez, as well as collective improvisationally-based groups such as AMM Music in London, and Musica Elettronica Viva in Rome soon followed suit. During the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s, with the advent of smaller and the more personal synthesizers invented by Moog, Buchla and others, the field of live electronic music became a practical reality. Some ten years later, a similar sequence of events took place with regard to computer music, where the large mainframes of the 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s were superseded by the PC revolution of the late 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s. This was followed by the more recent development of the laptop that has enabled performers to carry powerful, portable computers on stage. This course will trace these developments, examine the literature of the field, encourage live performances of \"classic\" pieces, and the creation and performance of new compositions and improvisations. It is strongly recommended that this course be taken in conjunction with Electro-Acoustic Ensemble. This course counts towards the music history requirement for music majors. Class size: 22",

Students will be introduced to foundational practices in electro-acoustic sound production and their contemporary/digital analogues, with particular emphasis on signal processing, studio and field recording, and modes of diffusion, including multichannel installation and live performance, and instruction in digital audio workstation software (Logic Pro, Pro Tools, and others). Examples from the history of electronic music will assist students in exploring contemporary approaches to electronic music software and technology. Enrollment in the course automatically gives students access to the Bard electronic music studios. In addition to the digital workstations, students can also explore analog synthesis techniques using the vintage Serge modular synthesizer. Class size: 20",

Both were influenced, albeit in very different ways, by folk music and both exhibited neo-Classical tendencies, again in very different ways. Both ended up in the United States and died in New York City. We will explore their respective cultural milieux in Budapest, St. Petersburg, Paris, and New York, and analyze some of their most important compositions, comparing and contrasting them at each stage of their careers. There will be reading and listening assignments, a midterm, a final quiz and two short papers (5 pages each). The course will count towards the music history requirements for music majors.

        "description": "The half-century from 1910 to 1960 saw an explosion of dissonance, complexity and apparent musical chaos. And yet, beneath the surface it was also an era of unprecedented intricacy of structure and musical systematization. The liberation of dissonance and dissolution of melody left composers insecure, and they often compensated by creating systems of tremendous rigor not always apparent to the listener. This course will analyze in depth several works that changed the way we think about composing, and which pioneered the growth of an atonal musical language. Explore the cinematographic intercutting of Stravinsky\u2019s Le Sacre du Printemps; the textural overlayering of Ives\u2019s Three Places in New England; the elegant mathematical proportioning of Bartok\u2019s Music for Strings Percussion and Celeste: the delicate symmetries of Webern\u2019s Symphonie Op. 21; the total organization of Stockhausen\u2019s Gruppen; and the compelling multi tempo climaxes of Nancarrow\u2019s Study No. 36. Intended for music majors, for whom it counts as music theory credit, but other strongly motivated students are welcome.

This seven-week class will survey episodes of musical protest in the United States from the Civil War to the #BlackLivesMatter movement. We will consider what the function, potential, and limits of musical protest have been in transforming American civic life. Our course will examine peace and abolition songs composed during the Civil War era, anti-capitalist and labor songs, songs against fascism, music of the Civil Rights Era, Vietnam War, Iraq War, activist music festivals, compositions that protest nuclear power and environmental damage, and recent music that addresses police brutality and structural racism. We will consider acts of musical protest aligned with \"the right side of history\" as well as music that challenges this very notion. We will include pieces that critique gender, class, and racial inequality in the United States, as well as pieces against violence, greed, and complacency. We end by analyzing songs that protest the very genre of \"protest music.\" Students will be required to write weekly reading and listening responses and produce a final research project around a single act of musical protest. You do not need to read musical notation to take this class. Class size: 22",

Tracing the historical developments of the movement, we\u2019ll analyze La Monte Young\u2019s The Well-Tuned Piano, a six-hour improvisatory piano work in altered tuning; Steve Reich\u2019s popular Music for 18 Musicians; Philip Glass\u2019s Einstein on the Beach; Tom Johnson\u2019s An Hour for Piano; John Adams\u2019s Phrygian Gates; and also postminimalist works by William Duckworth, Lois Vierk, Paul Epstein, Peter Garland, and others.

In addition to Beowulf and the Tempest, our readings will include Chaucer\u2019s Canterbury Tales; Geoffrey of Monmouth\u2019s History of the Kings of Britain; Spenser\u2019s Faerie Queene; and several \"romances\"\u2014the pop fiction about knights and their adventures\u2014that circulated widely in both Chaucer\u2019s medieval and Shakespeare\u2019s early-modern England.

That power, diffused into the lives of individual Americans by technological, political, and social change, simultaneously deepened a sense of powerlessness for some and fulfilled hopes and expectations for others: if you imaginatively identified with the nation and its privileged symbols\u2014for example, whiteness, masculinity, weaponry, and material plenty\u2014would you experience the promised sense of centrality and significance seemingly mandated by our military triumph, our wealth, our extraordinary global prestige, and our historical sense of providential destiny? Or would you experience, or even be aware of, America\u2019s failure to deliver on its promises? In this course, we will be looking at the ways in which American literature imagined and represented what it was like to live American lives between August 6, 1945, and September 11, 2001, the day when American verities and pieties underwent a sudden reckoning. We will begin by asking ourselves and our writers the same question with which R.W. Emerson opens his great essay, Experience:Where do we find ourselves? and go on to examine works by mid-to late twentieth-century and contemporary writers of fiction, nonfiction, drama, and poetry. Moreover we shall do so through explicit reference to traditions and problems bequeathed to us by American writing from the seventeenth-century on. Can we still see ourselves as the City on a Hill? What has happened to the democratic faith of Emerson and Whitman? Do we possess a \"usable past\"? Is ours a society marked by \"quiet desperation\"?

It is often asserted that nature is ubiquitous in Japanese literary expression, but how and why did this come to be? How has nature been narrated, harnessed and reimagined at varying moments and locations, and how have the values assigned to it been deployed in the construction of national identity and in the processes of modernity? Exploring the tensions in the environment as an object of aesthetic appreciation as well as a potentially destructive force, our examination will also extend to varying political, social, religious, and ethical dimensions of the human responses to the lived environment, including what the natural environment and disasters can teach us. In the wake of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, we will also be asking how attentions and concerns about environment have been raised and redirected, and will explore the emerging literary responses that have sought to grapple with life in an entirely changed landscape. Readings include a variety of fictional and nonfictional texts from the eighth century to the present, including classical court poetry, Matsuo Basho, Miyazawa Kenji, Kawabata Yasunari, Oe Kenzaburo, Kawakami Hiromi, ecofeminist critics, Okinawan poetry, and an Ainu memoir.

        "description": "2 credits It is 2016. Why aren\u2019t there more women in leadership positions? According to a 2014 Pew Research Center report, the majority of American men and women acknowledge the capacity of women to lead. Yet in certain domains\u2014most notably politics and business\u2014women continue to be under-represented at the top. This year\u2019s Presidential race will certainly polarize the electorate around constructions of gender in particularly dramatic ways. If we are living in a post-feminist society (as some claim), why do these questions and conflicts continue to arise? Identity is an urgent conversation in 21st-century politics and everyday life, and this includes awareness of how intersectionality shapes gendered experiences. What are the stories that we tell ourselves and each other about equality, representation, privilege, freedom, authority, and success? How do these inflect real-world outcomes for individuals and societies? In this two-credit course we will explore some of the stories that circulate in our culture around women and power, both from an academic and from a practical, real-world perspective. What does it mean to lead? How do we use a language of empowerment? Why has the United States embraced certain narratives of gender equity and success as opposed to those being created in other countries and cultures? We will focus on learning from women who are committed to making a difference in the world through their personal and professional choices, hearing their stories, and reading texts that have been particularly important to them in their lives and work. So too, we will engage with stories from the past (archival research), from across disciplines (the military, higher education, STEM, the arts, media) and from a wide range of perspectives. As an Engaged Liberal Arts and Sciences course, this seminar will provide students with the unique opportunity to bring theory and practice together in a very immediate sense: by the end of the term you will have identified a story only you can tell, whether it is based in political activism, community engagement, or work experience. Drawing on the rich resources here in Annandale as well as through Bard\u2019s other campuses, we will reach out to groups and organizations with a shared focus on gender. Network building is something we will explicitly address. This course is open to all first-year students, but enrollment is limited.",

        "description": "Cross-listed: Experimental Humanities; Literature Recent debates in literary studies regarding \"close\" and \"distant\" reading methods have emerged alongside rapid innovation in the field of natural language processing (NLP). These concurrent developments have sparked exciting collaborations between literary scholars and computer scientists (as evidenced by this co-taught course). Yet this burgeoning affinity can easily obscure the longer history of scholarly activity combining humanist and computational approaches to literature. In this course, we will chart the contours of this history -- stretching back to the early twentieth century -- and learn the fundamentals of NLP in order to consider new questions regarding changing literary patterns over time. We will read the works of foundational linguists and close-reading theorists (e.g., Victoria, Lady Welby; C. K. Ogden; I. A. Richards; William Empson; and Cleanth Brooks) as well as scholars of emergent critical reading practices (eg., N. Katherine Hayles, Franco Moretti, Sharon Marcus, and Stephen Best). We will explore these ideas by learning fundamentals of programming and then using them to apply NLP techniques such as parsing, sentence generation, language modeling, and creation of high-dimensional semantic spaces to problems in reading.

The African-American presence in Europe which included the iconic figure Josephine Baker as well as jazz great Louis Armstrong altered this picture in ways that we are only beginning to appreciate. This course looks at a period in which American culture found roots abroad. Class size: 18",

This course begins with a history of reading, storytelling and book culture in Arabic during the rise of Islam from the seventh through the fourteenth centuries. We will consider the role of the market, the scholar's libraries, the sultan's court, and notions of edification and culture as they contributed to an Arabic sense of bookishness and narration. The second half of the course will revisit this legacy as it infamously erupts into the modern, appearing as the founding conceit of Don Quixote, the exotic allure of European fascination with the \"Oriental tale\" and A Thousand and One Nights, and, as Edward Said would have it, a narrative incitement to empire.

Also, we will pay special attention to the present state of research on Dostoevsky, starting from the classic studies by Mikhail Bakhtin, Joseph Frank, and some others, to the latest works by Russian, American, European, and Japanese scholars of Dostoevsky.By looking at Dostoevsky through the lenses of poetics, philosophy, politics, and psychology, we will try to understand what makes this 19th century Russian writer our contemporary.

We will examine how new media interacts with and transforms culture by considering the emergence of digital media and internet culture in relation to prior moments of media change, and discuss how such shifts have continually re-shaped our perceptions of time, space, publicity, knowledge, and identity. The premise of this course is that the new-ness of new media can only be approached against the background of humanistic experimentation and imagination with both old and new media. We will read key media theorists (Walter Benjamin, Donna Haraway, Katherine Hayles, Henry Jenkins, Friedrich Kittler, and Marshall McLuhan), as well as contemporary fiction by authors such as Neal Stephenson and Gary Shteyngart that offer speculative visions of how digital media and human experience might determine one another in the future. As part of our ongoing examinations of how material conditions shape discourse, we will assess our own positions as users, consumers, and potential producers of media. This course fulfills a requirement for the Experimental Humanities concentration, and will involve a \"practice\" component that complements our engagement with media theory. Class size: 20",

This question drives Geoffrey Chaucer\u2019s Canterbury Tales and will likewise guide our semester-long exploration of it. An instant classic after Chaucer\u2019s death in 1400, the Canterbury Tales inspired \"fanfiction\" almost immediately and has since been enshrined as an essential work within the English literary canon, counting writers from Shakespeare to T.S. Eliot among its later readers and admirers. At odds with (or perhaps partly responsible for) its current \"insider\" and canonical status, though, is the fact that the Canterbury Tales remains one of the most radically experimental works written in English. By turns beautiful and dirty, politically risky and calculatedly evasive, poetry and prose, the Tales tests, negotiates, and worries over the ways in which language\u2014written, spoken, read, overheard\u2014constructs reality. It challenges gender and class norms; queries and queers the relationship between tale and teller; and calls into question institutional authority and social hierarchy. Following Chaucer\u2019s lead, we\u2019ll grapple with how literature does (and sometimes does not) influence social change; that is, what\u2019s the point of telling stories? Class size: 18",

        "description": "We have a complicated relationship with fictional characters. We are often drawn to them more than anything else in encounters with literature, theater, or film, but we also know, consciously or unconsciously, that they remain exactly what their name implies: circumscribed by typography, scriptedness, and the page or screen. On the one hand, characters may be understood as impressions or archetypes that are patterned on convention and social expectations. As such, they can tell us about the world that produced them, since they are enlisted in the kinds of situations that world promotes and recognizes. On the other hand, characters, according to E. M. Forster, are \"engaged in treason against the main scheme\" of a text; they feel like agents of resistance and individualism, and they seem to transcend both text and context as they reach out to us. This course studies the history of fictional characters in western literature, starting in classical Greece and Rome, moving through medieval and renaissance texts, and arriving at a discussion of character in the novel and in contemporary media. Texts may include Theophrastus\u2019s Characters, Plautus\u2019s Menaechmi, Chaucer\u2019s Canterbury Tales, Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet, Pirandello's Six Characters in Search of an Author, and Woolf\u2019s Mrs. Dalloway. We will also track changes in discussions about characters by studying critiques ranging from Aristotle to Barthes, Cixous and Derrida. Students will engage in analytical, critical, and creative work throughout the term, and will be encouraged to build their own fictional characters and study their personal favorites.

        "description": "Does poetry, as W.H. Auden once said, \"make nothing happen,\" or is \"the theory of poetry,\" as Wallace Stevens wrote, \"the theory of life\"? This course will, through an extensive study of four major British modernists\u2014-D.H. Lawrence, Virginia Woolf, W.B. Yeats, and W.H. Auden\u2014-examine the capacity of modern literature to both articulate and realize a comprehensive vision of life in its ethical, aesthetic, and political dimensions. We will be particularly interested in the way in which aesthetic practices, attitudes, and categories (disinterestedness, impersonality, beauty and sublimity, the ordering imagination) map onto ethical and political understandings of hierarchy, equality, otherness, feminism, and interpersonal relations. Related concerns will include: to what extent does this literature struggle to appropriate or even outmaneuver newly ascendant, competing discourses of human nature like psychoanalysis? To what extent can and should it evaluate or aesthetically transfigure major political events and social movements, and how did it intervene in the struggle between liberal democracy and fascism? Is it truly able, as many modernists hoped, to displace the moral agency of religion? Texts will include Lawrence\u2019s Sons and Lovers, Women in Love, The Plumed Serpent, and selections from his poetry and short fiction; Woolf\u2019s Mrs. Dalloway, To the Lighthouse, and The Waves; and the major poems of Yeats and Auden. Because we are interested in these writers\u2019 ethical visions, we will also consult prose manifestos such as Lawrence\u2019s Fantasia of the Unconscious, Woolf\u2019s Three Guineas, and Auden\u2019s The Prolific and the Devourer.",

The latter category includes Moby-Dick; or, the Whale, to which we will devote extended time mid-semester. Topics of interest, both to us and to the other scholars we will read, will include race, law, sexuality, and the nonhuman environment -- all while keeping our eyes on Melville's distinctive aesthetics. To explore those topics, we will put Melville in conversation with artists who have adapted his works (e.g., Orson Welles); with writers who have theorized American democracy and the African diaspora in ways resonant with his thinking (e.g., Harriet Jacobs and C. L. R. James, who wrote a seminal work of Melville criticism while detained on Ellis Island); and with other historical figures, particularly on the Pacific Rim, whose lives have been closely bound to the history of whaling (e.g., John Manjiro). This is a Junior Seminar, and as such we will devote substantial time to methods of research, writing, and revision. Class size: 15",

At the age of 18, he was expelled from Oxford for distributing his pamphlet,The Necessity of Atheism. Soon after, he publishedQueen Mab, a long poem that indicted organized religion as the root of all evil and prophesied the emergence of a post-moral utopia. The following year, Shelley eloped to Italy with Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin, the future author ofFrankenstein. Living in self-imposed exile for the remainder of his life, Shelley produced some of the most poetically and ideologically challenging literature in English. In addition to a close study of Shelley\u2019s work, this seminar will examine the major influences on his thought, from Plato to Schelling, as well as Shelley\u2019s impact on nineteenth- and twentieth-century philosophers, from Marx to Levinas.

The aim of the class is to help you explore the possibilities of form in relation to your chosen subject-matter. Form, by definition, involves limits. Free verse is not free. The poetic line is one simple limit; tone and cadence and diction are aspects of formal limits. Then there are imposed or prescribed limits, like the decision to write using only nouns beginning with the letter \"M\", or to write a poem without any adjectives, or a poem written using a procedure that moves language into unanticipated places, or a sonnet.

The personal essay is an informal essay that begins in the details of everyday life and expands to a larger idea. Emphasis is placed on reading closely to discover the craft of the work: how scenes and characters are developed, how dialogue can be used, how the form can fracture from linear narrative to the collage. Students\u2019 works\u2014three long essays\u2014are critiqued in a workshop format.

This course will serve two purposes. The first is to read, in its entirety, a beautiful, scholarly and complete translation of a work that one fifth of the world\u2019s population consider to be the best novel ever written. The second is to learn something about the cultural history of China, in particular attitudes and conceptions of gender. The late-imperial Chinese interest in gender and sexuality anticipates many contemporary post-modern concerns. No one text captures these trends better than the eighteenth-century masterpiece Shitou ji, The Story of the Stone, better known under the title used for the 120-chapter version Honglou meng, Dream of the Red Chamber. This course will combine a close reading of the novel and its commentaries with a review of recent scholarship on sex and gender in late-imperial China. Taught in English. Class size: 18",

        "department": "classic",
        "description": "Cross-listed: Literature The Iliad and Odyssey of Homer (ca. 8th century BCE) are the twin pillars upon which the Western literary tradition stands; between them, these two titanic works explore issues of human life and civilization\u2014mortality and heroism; the relationships between the human and the divine, men and women, free will and fate; the confrontation between European and other cultures; the nature of poetry, tragedy and comedy\u2014that have remained central ever since. This course, designed to introduce freshmen to more profound and sophisticated techniques of reading and thinking about literary texts than they will have thus far encountered, will consist of an intensive reading of both epics in their entirety over the course of one semester, focusing on in-depth discussion and textual explication, with a heavy emphasis on how to write critically about literary texts. After two prefatory sessions, in which students will be introduced to the large concerns of the epic genre in general (archaic Greek civilization, the epic cycle, oral composition, the Homeric Question) and of these two works in particular (the \"heroic code,\" violence and warfare, the clash of civilizations, ethnography and exploration, homecoming narratives, marriage), we will read through the epics at a rate of two books per session, two sessions per week. Students will be introduced, by means of excerpts and shorter articles, to the immense scholarship on Homer, especially with respect to oral composition and the Homeric Question. A premium will be placed on participation in class discussion and timely posting to Moodle discussion boards. At least three papers, midterm, final exam.",

How should Alexander be understood -- as a tyrant of Hitlerian proportions, or as a philosopher-king seeking to save the Greek world from self-destruction, or as an utterly deluded madman? Such questions remain very much unresolved among modern historians. In this course we will attempt to find our own answers (or lack of them) after reading the ancient sources concerning Alexander and examining as much primary evidence as can be gathered. Students will attain insight not only into a cataclysmic period of history but into the moral and ideological complexities that surround the assessment of historical personality, whether in antiquity or in the modern world. No prerequisite, but students will be greatly helped by some familiarity with Greek history or civilization. Class size: 22",

From a variety of different perspectives, they all ask the question: why literature? How can literature serve as a response to a problem (be it personal or political), or, taken from another angle, why is the questioning at the heart of literature often seemingly the sole solution? This class will explore many of the ways in which, over the past three and a half centuries, literature has attempted to grasp its own essence. Readings from Diderot, Rousseau, Stendhal, Balzac, Nerval, Baudelaire, Mallarm\u00e9, Breton, Sartre and Duras (among others). Taught in French.

        "department": "french",
        "description": "Cross-listed: Literature; Gender & Sexuality Studies The representation of private life in the nineteenth-century French novel coincided with the advent of Realism. Realism not only described the institutions that shaped private life (i.e., marriage, education, religion), but dwelled also on the discrete dramas occurring backstage--the solitude of the spinster (Flaubert's Un C\u0153ur simple), the plight of the child (Vall\u00e8s' L'Enfant, Renard's Poil de Carotte), the ambiguities of filial duties(Balzac, Eugenie Grandet, Flaubert Madame Bovary), the despair of domesticity (Maupassant's Une Vie), and the nature of neuroses (Zola, Nana). Using novels, stories, and short selections from journals and correspondences, this course will examine the emergence of writings previously considered too private, too personal to be viewed as literature. Students will also uncover the techniques that help dramatize these highly subjective conflicts (interior monologue, free indirect discourse, early examples of flow of consciousness). Issues of gender, sexuality, and the role of women in defining domesticity will be central. In order to situate these texts within a tradition that rethinks the self, there will be additional readings by Locke, Descartes, Kant, and Shaftesbury. Students will also read excerpts from recent anthologies about everyday life to examine the connection between literature, philosophy, social history, and anthropology. Taught in French.

The \"Middle Sea\" represented for millennia the locus of cultural encounters par excellence. As the current migration crises showcase, however, it also constitutes a key geopolitical space of negotiation between national pretenses and transnational mobility of ideas, cultures, and bodies. By virtue of its position at the center of the Mediterranean, Italy and its multilayered culture offered a number of provisional answers to the ceaseless struggles taking place between North and South, East and West, Orientalism and Occidentalism. The course will address pivotal works of Italian literature and cinema able to destabilize acquired assumptions on identity, migration, gender and exile, from Boccaccio to Montale, to Pasolini and Carlo Levi, with a particular focus on Mediterranean artists working in Italy today, such as Predrag Matvejevic, Boris Pahor, Elvira Dones and Ferzan \u00d6zpetek.

        "description": "In his essays Traveling Theory and Traveling Theory Reconsidered, Edward Said underscored the importance of context and geographical dispersal for revolutionary potential to emerge\u2014or to turn into domestication. In 1909 Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, an Italian poet stationed in Milan, but born in Alexandria (Egypt), founded in Paris the modern avant-garde with the publishing of his first Futurist Manifesto. Futurism\u2019s breakthrough claims of refashioning Western culture from its very foundations rapidly spread all over the world. Futurism\u2019s inextricable conundrum of art, politics and performance would then impact not only historical avant-gardes, from Dada to Surrealism, but also the idea of the intellectual as \"arsonist\" throughout the 20th Century. This course approaches Italian Avant-gardes\u2014with a focus also on Metaphysical Art and Magical Realism\u2014in the transnational circulation of aesthetics of the early 20th Century, between bombastic nationalist claims and tragic negotiations with Fascism. Engaging with both literature and art, the course unravels the intricate, yet fascinating knot of aesthetics and politics at the core of modernism, by studying the birth of the avant-garde and its many contradictions between national anxieties and global movements of ideas.

Are we all selfish machines controlled by our genes? This research intensive course will explore different experimental and empirical methodologies to study fundamental questions in evolutionary biology. Throughout the semester, students will learn how to \"measure\" the action of natural selection at different time scales using fossils, field sampling, laboratory experiments, and computer simulations. In addition, students will design and conduct an evolution experiment as part of an independent research project. More specifically, students will learn how to use whole-genome sequencing to identify the genetic mutations responsible for adaptation in experimental bacteria populations. Finally, students will study the lives and ideas of individuals associated with important developments and controversies in evolutionary biology while learning how evolutionary thinking can improve our understanding of current public health and societal issues.

How is the spread of a disease like the formation of a thought? This seminar series will examine the use of mathematical and physical models in biology with the goal of showing how the same conceptual framework gives quantitative intuition for very different biological systems. We shall develop four physical tools (scaling analysis, random processes, network theory, and information theory) and apply them to a wide range of biological systems from microbiology, neuroscience, botany, zoology, and epidemiology. Classes will alternate between lectures, in which a new model is presented, and student-led discussions of recent papers which apply the model. Students will read contemporary research and work in groups to present this research and solve problem sets. Prerequisite: Upper\nCollege standing in biology, or permission of instructor.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Experimental Humanities; Literature Recent debates in literary studies regarding \"close\" and \"distant\" reading methods have emerged alongside rapid innovation in the field of natural language processing (NLP). These concurrent developments have sparked exciting collaborations between literary scholars and computer scientists (as evidenced by this co-taught course). Yet this burgeoning affinity can easily obscure the longer history of scholarly activity combining humanist and computational approaches to literature. In this course, we will chart the contours of this history -- stretching back to the early twentieth century -- and learn the fundamentals of NLP in order to consider new questions regarding changing literary patterns over time. We will read the works of foundational linguists and close-reading theorists (e.g., Victoria, Lady Welby; C. K. Ogden; I. A. Richards; William Empson; and Cleanth Brooks) as well as scholars of emergent critical reading practices (eg., N. Katherine Hayles, Franco Moretti, Sharon Marcus, and Stephen Best). We will explore these ideas by learning fundamentals of programming and then using them to apply NLP techniques such as parsing, sentence generation, language modeling, and creation of high-dimensional semantic spaces to problems in reading.

Subjects explored in this class will include classic anthropological analyses of small-scale societies, the formation of the modern nation-state, civil society organizations, post-colonial forms of resistance, and identity politics. While the course focuses primarily on understanding various political forms, students will also be encouraged to apply readings to theorize modes of inhabiting and transforming power relations they encounter in their everyday life.

In what ways has violence become naturalized in the contemporary world? In this course, we will consider how acts of violence challenge and support modern ideas of humanity, raising important questions about what it means to be human today. These questions lie at the heart of anthropological thinking and also structure contemporary discussions of human rights. Anthropology\u2019s commitment to \"local culture\" and cultural diversity has meant that anthropologists often position themselves in critical opposition to \"universal values,\" which have been used to address various forms of violence in the contemporary world. The course will approach different forms of violence, including ethnic and communal conflicts, colonial education, torture and its individualizing effects, acts of terror and institutionalized fear, and rituals of bodily pain that mark individuals\u2019 inclusion or exclusion from a social group. The course is organized around three central concerns. First, we will discuss violence as a means of producing and consolidating social and political power, and exerting political control. Second, we will look at forms of violence that have generated questions about \"universal rights\" of humanity versus culturally specific practices, such as widow burning in India and female genital mutilation in postcolonial Africa. In these examples, we explore gendered dimensions in the experience of violence among perpetrators, victims, and survivors. Finally, we will look at the ways human rights institutions have sought to address the profundity of human suffering and pain, and ask in what ways have they succeeded and/or failed. Readings will range from theoretical texts, anthropological ethnographies, as well as popular representations of violence in the media and film. Class size: 22",

Within this imagery, nature is racialized, and Africans are constructed as existing in a state closer to nature. Conrad\u2019s Heart of Darkness perhaps best exemplifies this process, through its exploration of the \u2018savage\u2019 dimensions of colonialism in the African interior. Imperial discourses often relied on these tropes of savagery and barbarism to link understandings of natural history with ideas about racial difference. Similarly, by blurring the boundary between the human and the nonhuman, colonial policies created a zone of anxiety around racialized domestic relationships, particularly in the context of employers and their servants. Many of these representations were contradictory, as evidenced by Rousseau\u2019s image of the noble savage: indigenous people who lived as gentle custodians of the environment, while at the same time preying upon resources desired for exclusive colonial use. After investigating the racialization of nature under imperial regimes, we will consider continuing legacies in post-colonial situations. How have certain ethnic identities been linked to nature? How do these associations reproduce social hierarchies and inequalities? In what ways is race invoked in struggles for land and resource rights? Through an exploration of ethnographic accounts, historical analyses, and works of fiction based in Africa, this course offers a new way of deciphering cultural representations of nature, and the fundamentally political agendas that lie within.

That is, they are both the product of social conditions and, in turn, the condition of possibility for our collective ways of life. In calling science and technology political acts, we do not seek to dismiss their forms of practice (nor, for many of the authors we read, their claims to objectivity).

The macroeconomics component studies the aggregate behavior of modern economies - the factors leading to economic growth, explanations of booms and recessions, unemployment, interest rates, inflation, and budget deficits or surpluses \u2013 and the government\u2019s ability (or inability) to use monetary and fiscal policies to achieve economic goals such as full employment and price stability.

In order to meet the last objective, we will devote most of the weekly \"lab\" sessions toward problem solving. During the lab sessions, students are expected to take turns explaining how to solve a particular problem to the rest of the class.

We then compare the trajectories of economic change during the twentieth century. Particular attention is paid to the various economic models pursued in the region, including the colonial export economy of Southeast Asia, export-oriented industrialization in Japan, South Korea and Southeast Asia, import-substituting industrialization in India, and the communist economy of Mao\u2019s China and mainland Southeast  Asia.

What are the pros and cons of a flexible/fixed exchange rate system? What are FDIs? What is a balance-of-payments crisis? Why do countries default or go bankrupt? What are the roles and actions of institutions such as the Central Bank and the IMF? What is an optimum currency area?

Many young people today fear that Social Security will go bankrupt long before they will reach retirement age. Costs of medical care continue to grow faster than GDP. Many private pensions are underfunded, and employers are switching from defined benefit plans to risky defined contribution plans. Will we be able to take care of growing numbers of seniors? If Social Security fails, will you have to support your own parents? Will you be able to accumulate enough retirement savings to see you through your \"golden years\"? How has \"Obamacare\" ameliorated gaps in our healthcare system? Does the proposal pushed by Bernie Sanders to extend Medicare-like coverage to all Americans make sense?

It traces the complex processes of conquest, empire building, and the creation of many diverse, complex, and dynamic communities, societies, and cultures from the convergence of Native, European, African, and Asian peoples. The course considers peoples in the Spanish and Portuguese Empires of North and South America in three centuries, from the late fifteenth to the early nineteenth century, starting with the first native settlements and indigenous societies. Focusing primarily on the Conquest of Mexico, empire and indigenous society in Mesoamerica, and African slavery in Brazil, the class is based mainly on original sources like codices, native language writings, and documents on the history of Brazilian slavery. It will reflect on the peoples, places, events, as well as beliefs, cultures, and conflicts of a world different from our own to understand the historical legacies of the colonial period in contemporary Latin America.

In modern times Jewish culture became more voluntary and more fractured. While some focused on Judaism as (only) a religion, both the most radical and the most typical way in which Jewishness was redefined was in secular terms. In this course we will explore the intellectual, social, and political movements that led to new secular definitions of Jewish culture and identity, focusing on examples from Western and Eastern Europe and the United States. Topics will include the origins of Jewish secularization, haskalah (Jewish enlightenment) and Reform, acculturation and assimilation, modern Jewish political movements including Zionism, and Jews and the arts. In addition to secondary historical texts we will pay special attention to a wide variety of primary source documents. The class will also incorporate materials drawn from literature, film, and music. Class size: 22",

Why did Japan\u2019s transformations during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries lead to the total war of the 1930s and 1940s? And why did the horrible destruction experienced after World War II ultimately result in rapid economic growth and renewed global importance for Japan after the 1950s? These questions provide the framework for our study of modern Japanese history. Throughout the course we will focus special attention on Japan\u2019s distinctive urban culture, the changing role of women in Japanese society, the re-invention of Japan\u2019s imperial institution, the domestic and international effects of Japanese imperialism, and the question of the United  States\u2019 role in Japan\u2019s post-war reconstruction.

Each week we will illuminate pivotal transformations in the era using different methodologies and forms of history, ranging from demographic and gender history to diplomatic and military history. The class will thus offer an in-depth presentation of key aspects of modernity and a survey of contemporary historiography. Issues discussed will include: the relation of the agricultural and industrial revolutions to long-term ecological and demographic change; the intensification of capitalism as the basis of social organization; the coextensive development of competing ideologies of conservatism, anarchism, socialism, communism and liberalism; the role of Europe in the global economic system, \"scientific racism,\" and neo-colonialism; the creation of new institutions of technological research, patent, and communication; the wars of the twentieth century, systematic genocide, and the development of a military-industrial technocracy; the transformation of the state system through the European Union; and the effect of mass media on definitions of the public sphere and political action. A rudimentary grasp of modern European history is assumed, but supplemental reading will provide a broad narrative base for students with no background in the field.

How should Alexander be understood -- as a tyrant of Hitlerian proportions, or as a philosopher-king seeking to save the Greek world from self-destruction, or as an utterly deluded madman? Such questions remain very much unresolved among modern historians. In this course we will attempt to find our own answers (or lack of them) after reading the ancient sources concerning Alexander and examining as much primary evidence as can be gathered. Students will attain insight not only into a cataclysmic period of history but into the moral and ideological complexities that surround the assessment of historical personality, whether in antiquity or in the modern world.

This field also entails broader histories of piracy, censorship, and the making of modern subjectivities. To understand the relationships of a technology to its social contexts and consequences, we will study: 1) how books were made in the early age of moveable type; and 2) how books were used to teach people how to do things in the world. With respect to the former, the course will include hands-on workshops in letterpress printing and digital book-making. Toward the latter, we will read from the how-to manuals that abounded in the period, including free-standing books and pamphlets on such diverse subjects as agriculture, conversation, cookery, fishing, medicinals, handwriting, spiritual exercises, housewifery, domestic service, fencing, witch-hunting, weaponry, shoe-making, and navigation.

Shanghai and Hong Kong, as international industrial and business centers, and the main conduits for overseas direct investment, are China\u2019s global cities, but they are cities with long, cosmopolitan pasts. This course explores the history of Hong Kong\u2019s and Shanghai\u2019s current economic, social, and cultural dynamism, and in doing so probes the historical roots of globalization. It analyzes how nineteenth- and early twentieth-century colonialism and semi-colonialism both drove and conditioned, in somewhat different ways, the development of these two cities. It also asks how this earlier phase of integration into global networks of commerce and culture relates to the patterns of the present. Through diverse sources such as fiction, film, drama, advertisements, photography, memoirs, and comics, we will delve into how economic and cultural flows have affected politics, economics, and the culture of everyday life over the past century and a half.

In this course, we will read about the \"woman question\" in the medical, legal, religious, and political discourses of the early modern period through processes such as the centralization of European states, Protestant and Catholic reformations, explorations, and colonial settlement.

However, where possible, we will focus on women\u2019s cultural production \u2013 literary, musical, and artistic.

We will examine patterns of reaction variously termed passive, armed, cultural and spiritual resistance. We will also look at the range of behaviors among bystander groups including collaboration, inaction, and rescue. By reading a number of scholars with widely varying views, including Hannah Arendt, Yehuda Bauer, and Isaiah Trunk, we will grapple with the issues raised on several levels: Theoretically, what are the most useful definitions of these terms? Empirically, how can we assess the extent of resistance and collaboration that took place historically? Ethically, what types of behavior are \"reasonable\" or morally justified in such extreme circumstances? This course is designated as a Major Conference for students in Historical Studies. All students are required to write a substantial research paper considering these questions as they apply to a particular event or group during the Holocaust or another historical case study.

How have particular modes of history developed in relation to nationalism, imperialism, and the emergence of the modern state? How have modern historical techniques served to produce ideology? Moreover, how has history provided a tool for unmasking and challenging different forms of domination and the ideologies that help to perpetuate them? This course will address these questions through theoretical readings that offer diverse perspectives on the place of narrative in history, the historian's relation to the past, the construction of historiographical discourses, and the practice of historical commemoration. Other readings will critically assess the powerful roles that historical narrative, commemoration, and institutions like the museum have played in the processes of imperialism and nation building, as well as in class and gender politics. Some of the writers to be discussed will be Hayden White, Dominick LaCapra, Michel Foucault, G.W.F. Hegel, Walter Benjamin, Joan Wallach Scott, and theorists active in the Subaltern Studies movement. In addition to our common readings, students will write a research paper that builds on the critical perspectives we have discussed during the semester. Students who have moderated in history are particularly welcome. This course satisfies the Historical Studies Program's historiography requirement. Class size: 15",

How have they continued to challenge and shape our social and cultural conceptions of individuality, education, political responsibility, and social engagement? In what ways do the arts contribute to our political culture and education as citizens? In the 1990s, the defense of the arts as exemplary of democratic freedom and diversity failed to save the federal grant program for individual artists. Are the arts not just exemplary of, but fundamental to, our democratic culture, even essential to its continuation? How is reconsideration of the founding conceptions of our democracy a philosophical task? How is it a task of the arts and critical writing about the arts? We will explore these questions through discussions of philosophical works by John Locke, John Stuart Mill, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Stanley Cavell; Hollywood films of the 1930s and 1940s; works of feminist philosophy by Marilyn Frye and Nancy Bauer; and works of art and criticism by James Baldwin, Bruce Nauman, Glenn Ligon, Claudia Rankine, and others.

However, political scientists and economists do not always use the term in the same sense. Even within these two disciplines the term has multiple meanings. The course will review the ideas of a few major thinkers such as Adam Smith, Karl Marx, Karl Polanyi, Thorstein Veblen, John Maynard Keynes, and John Kenneth Galbraith, and will introduce students to two subfields in particular: international political economy and the political economy of development. Among the questions we would ask are: Why are some countries rich and others poor? What is development? What are the prime movers of globalization? Is the US an empire given its influence and power in the global economy? How can development be redefined to tackle the challenge of climate change? Among issues that we will look at closely is the role of organizations such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the World Trade Organization in managing the global economy and the current debates about reforming these institutions.

After a brief introduction to core concepts of American global strategy, the many factors that policymakers must take into account, including Russian motivations and policies, and the internal situation in countries like Ukraine and Syria, from political and economic points of view will be studied. We will also look at the role of actors like the EU, Turkey, China, Japan and Iran, the military equation and the nature of American interests as they are affected by Russia. Readings, lectures and conversation with Russian and American experts will give you a sound foundation from which to understand both the forces at work and the nature of American debate about policy options. With this background, students will look at current U.S. policy and the leading alternatives. In their final paper, students will be challenged to apply the skills and insights they have developed in the course to proposing an American strategy for Russia. Class size: 22",

The first explores the philosophical foundations of the notion of human rights and its contested universality, and the historical developments that propelled human rights to the forefront of international politics, especially the atrocities of World War II committed by Germany's Nazi regime.The second part of the course focuses on the evolution of the so-called \"international human rights regime,\" or the main actors and institutions in the human rights arena responsible for promoting and policing human rights--from the basic legal framework of human rights (the 1948 United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights), to major multilateral human rights institutions, such as the UN Human Rights Council, the International Criminal Court, and the European Court of Human Rights, to prominent non-state actors such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Freedom House, and the International Center for Transitional Justice. The third part examines the evolution of human rights, especially the shifts from \"first generation\" human rights (political freedoms) to \"second generation\" human rights (social and economic rights, such as housing, employment, and education), to \"third generation human rights\" and beyond (cultural self-determination, economic sustainability, and sexual freedoms, among others); and the means by which these shifts have come about andhavespreadaround the globe, such as international socialization,globalization, and policy diffusion.

        "department": "politicalstudies",
        "description": "Cross-listed: Global & International Studies; Human Rights What does it mean to be a global citizen? This question has gained increasing salience as the world has become more globalized. With globalization new problems surface that cut across national borders and fall outside the jurisdiction of individual nation-states. In response new forms of political organization have emerged to address these problems, which challenge the state as the primary locus of political authority and ultimate source of individual rights. In particular, these individuals and groups have appealed to a kind of global citizenship from below to call for action on and demand redress for the harms created by globalization. This interdisciplinary course critically examines the conceptual and theoretical foundations of the concept of global citizenship and investigates how the idea might work in practice. We begin by considering the conceptual, philosophical and historical debates about citizenship. What does it mean to be a citizen of a particular state? What obligations and responsibilities accompany citizenship? How have understandings of citizenship changed and expanded over time? What is global citizenship and how does it differ from national citizenship? Next we evaluate these ideas about citizenship in the context of globalization and the new problems created by an increasingly interdependent world. Topics covered may include: migration and refugees; the environment and resources; (in)security and borders; health and infectious disease; and development and inequality. We conclude by assessing the role (if any) global citizenship can play in global governance and consider how the international system might be transformed to better address the challenges of globalization.This course will be taught concurrently at Bard's international partner institutions. Students will benefit from collaboration with peers at these institutions. Class size: 22",

Much of the emphasis is on the evolution of democracy across the region, including examining such questions as why it has taken so long for democracy to take root in Latin America, at least in contrast to the United States and Western Europe, and why does the quality of democracy varies so greatly across the region. Although some democracies are among the most developed in the world, such as Chile, Uruguay and Costa  Rica, the region is also home to some notorious \"illiberal\" democracies, such as Guatemala, and one of the world\u2019s few remaining Communist states, Cuba. The course is organized in three main sections. The first provides a broad historical overview of patterns of political development in Latin  America from the independence period to the present. The second part highlights theoretical approaches to Latin American political development drawn from cultural analysis, Marxism, and state-centric perspectives. The third and final section examines democratic development in five Latin American countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Cuba, and Venezuela). Class size: 18",

The awareness of the importance of the region and potential for instability animates much of American foreign policy, with the recently released 2015 National Security Strategy focused on the area in part due to the \"security dynamics of the region\" which \"risk escalation and conflict\". What are these \"security dynamics\" that risk instability? This class will identify and address some of the primary security concerns animating the interest in the region and the ongoing calls for an American presence. We will cover the debates surrounding the \"rise of China\" and the implications that has for the US-China relationship, but we will also focus on intra-regional concerns such the proliferation and development of nuclear weapons and the potential remilitarization of Japan. As well, we will identify and explore the nature of some of the major regional maritime disputes (China-Japan, South China Sea), tensions between China and Taiwan, and multilateral security institutions. Finally, we will identify potential areas for security and cooperation within the region as well as with major players internationally. Class size: 22",

But the difficulties with the idealized model of the nation-state are quite apparent for all to see. For instance, various forms of ethno-national mobilization--based on solidarities both larger and smaller than the nation-state\u2014have challenged official state nationalisms. The twenty first century opened with talk of moving beyond the nation-state. But at that time in certain parts of the world multi-national political spaces were getting reorganized along national lines. This was also when failing and collapsed states became top foreign policy concerns of major powers, and a new form of international regimes of intervention came into being. The course will examine the idea of the nation -- its historical and contemporary competitors -- the emergence of the nation-state system, and the challenges confronting this system. Our approach will be comparative and we will draw on the experiences of all world regions.

While only recently coming to dominate the US national security agenda, terrorism as a political activity has a long history. This seminar will provide a theoretical and empirical examination of terrorism as a political phenomenon. The first part of the course will explore the conceptual and theoretical debates surrounding terrorism. Topics discussed will include the distinctions between terrorism and other forms of political violence, why individuals and groups resort to terrorism to achieve political goals, the role of religion and ideology in motivating terrorist groups, and the importance of state sponsorship in supporting terrorist activity. The second part will address the challenges of counterterrorism, including the strengths and weaknesses of counterterrorist tools such as military force, diplomacy, intelligence and law enforcement, the relationship between counterterrorism and democracy, the role of the international community in stopping terrorism. Throughout the course special effort will be made to situate the US experience with terrorism in a comparative and historical perspective through an examination of prominent case studies drawn from different regions and time periods.

We then evaluate these perspectives in light of the historical record, to illustrate the varied dynamics of interaction among great powers under different political conditions. Historical cases covered include: the unification of Germany, World Wars I & II and the emergence of and peaceful end to the Cold War. Contemporary topics include the resurgence of Russia, the rise of China and the future of American power. The course aims to gain a better understanding of the relevance of great power politics to international order, to appreciate the importance and limits of historical analogies in understanding world politics, and to learn the art of using historical research in international relations.

        "description": "Cross-listed: American Studies; Historical Studies This course examines the political and historical development of the US presidency from the founding until the present day. The course is divided into three parts. In the first part of the course, we explore the emergence of the modern presidency as the central institution of the American political system. In addition to the founding, we will give special attention to the Jeffersonian and Progressive Eras as well as the expansion of executive power under FDR. Throughout this first part of the course we will also examine how the presidency developed various powers beyond the formal constitutional responsibilities of the office, including party leadership, control of the executive branch, and relations with the public. In the second part of the course, we will critically explore the operation of the modern presidency from FDR to the present. In particular, we will see how modern presidents contend with multiple, and, at times, conflicting roles and responsibilities (party leader, chief executive, commander in chief, media celebrity) in an increasingly complex political environment. In the third part of the course, we will consider the problem of contemporary presidential power. In particular, we will ask whether presidential power is enlarged or diminished in the present era of divided government, hyper-partisanship, intensified media culture, economic and ecological volatility, and the shifting geopolitical environment confronting the United States. We will also ask what role presidential power and leadership should play in the life of contemporary American democracy. We will consider these questions in light of the Obama presidency and the 2016 election. Class size: 15",

The importance of cultivating compassion and wisdom, and the hard realities of impermanence and death are among Buddhism\u2019s guiding concerns. Across diverse cultural landscapes, Buddhism comprises a wide array of philosophical perspectives, ethical values, social hierarchies, artistic and literary traditions, and ritual technologies. It is linked to politics, cultures, institutions, and personalities, just as it is geared towards renunciation. Buddhism\u2019s various faces can seem inconsistent, and they are frequently out of keeping with popular expectations. This course offers an introduction to Buddhism\u2019s foundational themes, practices, and worldviews. As we highlight commonalities, we will also pay attention to the variations that occur as Buddhism interacts with different cultures over time, considering topics such as gender, the place of the arts, and the defining features of religion more broadly. Beginning with Buddhism\u2019s origination in India, we will trace its spread and development throughout Asia, focusing on China, Japan and Tibet. We will also consider its more recent developments worldwide. Class size: 22",

In this seminar students read and analyze poetry from Buddhist cultures, including Indian, Chinese, Japanese, and Tibetan literary traditions. Our focus is on poems that are emblematic of Buddhist themes such as impermanence, interdependence, perception of the present moment, renunciation, and empathy. We also read and discuss poems from Christian, Hindu, Jewish, and Islamic traditions to situate Buddhist poetry within a wider context of religious literature. Considering a broad scope of religious literature allows students to analyze how poetic forms work to express common themes such as the nature of the self and the relationship to the divine. This course focuses on primary source materials in translation. Our primary aim is to pinpoint aspects of Buddhist philosophy that lend themselves particularly well to \u2013 or perhaps even require \u2013 poetic expression. Class size: 22",

The focus of the course will be primarily on ancient Zoroastrianism, and on the classical textual tradition, especially the Avesta and Middle Persian literature. We will also examine Zoroastrianism in Colonial India, the Islamic Republic of Iran, and across the Diaspora; look at the great variety of Zoroastrian responses to modernity; and consider the appearance of Zoroastrianism in modern media, including film, works of modern philosophy (mostly famously,Nietzsche)and novels. Apart from opening a window into an influential, if little understood, religious tradition, studying Zoroastrianism will allow us to consider key issues in the study of religion, such as the dynamics of influence and the evolution of religions. NOTE: No previous knowledge of the topic is expected, even as engagement with any of the major religious traditions will be illuminated by the study of Zoroastrianism. *Class will meet August 31, Sept. 7, 14, 21, 28, Oct. 26, Nov. 2, 9, 16, 30, and Dec. 7, 14.

What are the sources of this inequality? Is social inequality inevitable? Is it undesirable? Through lectures, documentary films and class discussions, this course examines the ways by which socially-defined class, gender, race and ethnic categories are unevenly rewarded for their social contributions. Sociological theories are used to explain how and why social inequality is produced and maintained, and how it affects the well-being of individuals and social groups. The course will focus on two general themes. The first deals with the structure of inequality while studying the unequal distribution of material and social resources (e.g., social status, wealth, power). The second examines the processes that determine the allocation of people to positions in the stratification system (e.g. educational attainment, social capital, parental wealth, institutional discrimination).

Thus, the study of social and political dynamics in urban centers is crucial if we are to understand and address the pressing issues of the contemporary world. This course will allow students to explore these dynamics through an introduction to urban sociology: the study of social relations, processes, and changes in the urban context. We will begin by reading perspectives on the development of cities, followed by an examination of how the city and its socio-spatial configuration affect and are affected by social interactions, particularly across gender, race, and class lines. The course will then consider the relationship between globalization and the modern city before concluding with a few examples of how citizens address the challenges in their communities. Throughout, we will explore the diverse methods that social scientists use to understand these dynamics, and students will have the opportunity to utilize some of these methods in an investigation of a local \"urban community.\" Class size: 22",

Most of our time, however, will be spent with contemporary authors in the new and developing field of \"economic sociology.\" These authors help us to see the ways that the economy is \"embedded\" in society and in culture: in worldviews, in moral frameworks, and in social-relational structures. Topics covered in the course will include: (1) social patterns of consumption, (2) commodification of emotion in the service economy, (3) roles of law and social action in the branding of products and places, (4) social foundations of modern, industrial capitalism, and (5) social, moral, and legal meanings of money.

The course will be concerned with the theory and rationale upon which social research is based, as well as the practical aspects of research and the problems the researcher is likely to encounter. The course is divided into two parts. In the first, we will learn how to formulate research questions and hypotheses, how to choose the appropriate research method for the problem, and how to maximize chances for valid and reliable findings. In the second part, we will learn how to perform simple data analysis and how to interpret and present findings in a written report. For a final paper, students use data from the U.S. General Social Survey (GSS) to study public attitudes toward issues such as abortion, immigration, inequality and welfare, affirmative action, gender roles, religion, the media, and gun laws. By the end of the semester, students will have the necessary skills for designing and conducting independent research for term papers and senior projects, as well as for non-academic enterprises.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Global & International Studies; Human Rights; Philosophy; Religion In this course, we will compare ancient and modern legal systems from a sociological perspective. Our focus will be on Eurasian traditions, which have been influencing one another for a very long time. We will begin in Ancient Iraq and India, and from there we will move to Israel, Athens, and Rome. We will then travel to medieval Europe, cycling back around to the law schools of Istanbul (Constantinople) and Beirut, and glancing briefly at Islamic Jurisprudence. We will conclude with the Enlightenment, and modern legal systems. Our comparative focus will be on the differing social types who have engaged in law-giving and law-finding activity: kings, priests, and prophets; philosophers, clerics, and scholars; rhetoricians and \"professionals.\" We will seek to understand the ways that these social actors may have thought about what they were doing, and the social-historical conditions under which they engaged in their distinctive forms of activity. The fundamental goal of this course will be to reveal the rich cultural lineages of modern legal systems, and the historical particularity of such systems. This course is part of the \"Difficult Questions\" cluster of courses; students will be expected to attend parts of the Hannah Arendt Center Conference \"Real Talk: Difficult Questions about Race, Sex, and Religion\" on October 20-21.

        "description": "Cross-listed: American Studies; Science, Technology & Society Drawing on the sociology of deviance and social control, this course moves beyond the idea that the social effects of drugs are determined solely by their pharmacology. You will learn to think about drug use as a historically situated social practice by examining how social forces shape patterns of drug use, drug markets, and drug cultures. In addition, the course examines the history of US drug policy, the social construction of drug problems, and the far-reaching consequences of the war on drugs. Although the class focuses on the illegal drugs and other \"problem\" substances in the United States, we also consider the development of pharmaceuticals and their role in processes of medicalization. Finally, you will examine the history of the idea of addiction and its links to both criminalization and medicalization. Throughout, we unpack how medical, penal, and self-help approaches to drug control and treatment reflect differing modes of governance and embed assumptions about human nature. The course situates these questions in politics of race, class, and gender. Class size: 22",

        "department": "bgia",
        "description": "Non-state actors have gained increasing importance in international affairs. From transnational advocacy groups to terrorist networks to multinational corporations, a diverse range of actors are challenging and limiting the power of traditional nation-states and changing the landscape of the international system. This course explores the theoretical debates and practical policy effects of non-state actors in international affairs. How should we define non-state actors? Given the diversity of non-state actors and their goals, can we study them from a single perspective? Under what conditions do non-state actors \"matter\" and what effects do they have? What strategies do different non-state actors use to influence policy-making? What role do non-state actors play in global governance? The goal of the course is to provide students with a working knowledge of the major academic debates and controversies about the definition, emergence and evolution of non-state actors in international affairs. We will investigate the changing roles and influence of non-state actors in a variety of issue areas, including global governance, security affairs, human rights, public health, international development and international economics, among others. In addition, the course will contextualize students\u2019 internship experiences within this broader discussion to critically examine how ideas about the role of non-state actors in world politics play out in practice. We will take advantage of our New York City location with guest speakers from a wide spectrum of organizations within the field, such as the United Nations, US State Department, Human Rights Watch, Council on Foreign Relations, World Policy Institute, Open Society Foundation, Central American Legal Assistance, Control Risks Group, East/West Institute, Asia Society and many others. The overriding objective throughout the course is to link students\u2019 academic experience with their practical experience.",

This change, as New York Times reporter Mark Landler noted, \"happened so fast that it left the foreign policy establishment gasping to catch up.\" This course examines how foreign policy and international affairs are being shaped in the age of the Internet. Topics include democracy versus censorship, conflict, climate change and the environment, big data and privacy, global economics and the movement of capital. Among the questions we will explore are: \u2022   What is the changing nature of power? Are there actors? \u2022   How is the concept of the nation-state changing? \u2022   What constitutes world order in this new era? \u2022   How have the Internet, the mobile phone, and other technologies changed the conduct of foreign affairs?",
