Covering many aspects of architecture from buildings, drawings, models, exhibitions, and schools, to historical and theoretical writings and manifestoes we will investigate a range of modernist practices, polemics, and institutions. The readings, both primary and secondary texts, have been selected both to provide an overview of the history of modern architecture and to offer a number of critical and historical approaches to evaluating its legacy. Figures discussed include Schinkel, Paxton, Sullivan, Wright, Oud, Corbusier, Mies, and Aalto. Requirements include two short written assignments, a midterm, and a final exam. No prerequisites.

This means looking at, analyzing, talking about, and writing about visual images, including art works, film, television, advertising, and other modes of visual culture. The term \"visual culture\" has a double sense: first, it can mean the actual visual materials produced in a given place and time, and it can also mean the way in which we are enculturated (trained by our culture or society) to read images. We'll spend the semester thinking about and comparing different types of visual communications, and thinking about the many ways one can interpret their messages-and the reasons why their meanings shift from context to context.Our thinking and reading brings together philosophies of art, communication, and media studies, as well as the history of art.Assignments and Exams: midterm and final exams; four short papers and generous participation in discussion.Class size: 22",

Behind each of these specific measuring devices is a culture of production that informed its making or the map images produced by these tools. This course is a critical examination of the visual history and cultural production of maps as various discourses of power, nation building, identity formation, and economics. Foundations for the class are built on texts written by geographers, sociologists, and urban or art historians such as J. B. Harley, Dennis Cosgrove, David Buissert, Henri Lefebvre, and Edward Soja as well as authors who theorize the future production of maps using digital technologies. From prehistoric cave drawings to spatial history digital projects, topics will include mapmaking traditions in Western Europe, ancient and medieval China, Islamic Central and South Asia, pre-contact America, as well as the intersection of these practices and the application of digital mapping within this history. Short writing assignments will complement individual and collaborative digital projects aimed at gaining a familiarity with different methods of mapping. Class size: 22",

        "description": "Cross listed: Photography; Human Rights; Science, Technology & Society In the decades after World War II, photography\u2019s social and artistic roles changed in many ways. The 1950s saw the dominance of magazine photography in Life and Look and witnessed the birth of a more personal photographic culture, exemplified by Robert Frank\u2019s book The Americans. In the 1960s and 1970s, photographers such as Diane Arbus, Garry Winogrand, and Lee Friedlander created a new view of contemporary life from moments gathered in the streets and from private lives. Beginning in the late 70s, artists trained outside of traditional photography began to employ the camera for wholly different purposes, using photography to pose ideological questions about images and image-making in a media-saturated culture. Today, the transformation of photography through digital technology has again thrown the meaning(s) of photographically-derived images into question. This lecture/discussion class will cover the historical context of this period and tease out fundamental issues of photography and its ostensible nature and the politics of representation. Student performance will be evaluated in class discussion, exams, and papers. No prerequisites, but preference will be given to moderated photography and moderated art history students.

We will pursue relevant questions such as: what exactly are the criteria for inclusion in such categories, do art markets drive this labeling, how does this work function within the art world, are categorical borders crossed in order to fit the needs of exhibiting institutions, and finally how has Outsider Art impacted mainstream modern and contemporary art and are the dividing lines between the two still relevant? We will look at artwork produced within certain institutional settings such as mental asylums and prisons, as well as that produced by mediums, spiritualists and other \"visionaries\" working within what can be best described as a \"folk art\" category.

In the past several decades it has also been become more stylized for performances on stage and in dance competitions in the Middle East and abroad. This class will offer the opportunity to learn some \"traditional\" versions of dabkeh, danced in a line or a circle, as well as more contemporary choreographies designed for the stage. We will draw especially on forms of dabkeh danced and performed in Palestine today. No prior experience in dance or in dabkeh necessary. Sneakers or flat, hard-soled boots are required. ",

Technique class is structured as a laboratory where physical possibilities are explored with a mixture of rigor and freedom, specificity and abandon. Technique class will also be a place of critical thinking. The material we study exists to nourish our creative bodies/minds, challenging us to re-articulate/re-imagine our relationships to codified movement systems. Students must have a strong technical foundation, be self-motivated, and be capable of handling the demands of a four-day-a-week class. Readings, written assignments, and attendance at performances outside of regular class hours are essential aspects of the course, augmenting our intellectual understanding of technique and performance.Co-taught by Leah Cox and Trisha Brown Dance Company faculty.

Is it possible to create a new kind of dance product or new danceknowledge? What happens when we make work from a space of curious unknowing instead of confident knowing? In Comp III, we will investigate how we can reimaginethe creative process in order to surprise ourselves with what it produces. We will draw from the movement-based ideas generated by philosophy, cultural studies, as well asdance makers past and present to generate our own processes and questions.We'll also explore the importance of working in other creative forms (primarily visual arts) as a way to increase our understanding of our primary art form (dance, movement). Essential to our trajectory will be an increase in our dance literacy: our ability to see and speak about dance in its own milieu as well as understand its implications for and relevance to larger cultural contexts.

The course will focus on a relatively small number of major filmmakers: the early pioneers of the 1940s (Deren, Peterson, Menken, and Broughton); the mythopoeic artificers of the 1950's and early 1960's (Anger, Brakhage, and Baillie); and the formalists of the late 1960s, (Frampton, Snow and Gehr). We will also pay attention to the strong graphic/collage cinema of artists like Cornell, Conner, Smith, and Breer as well as to the anarchic, comic improvisations of figures like Jacobs, Kuchar, and MacLaine. We will end in the mid 1970's by touching on the movement's then future prospects, e.g. the revitalization of storytelling through autobiography (Mekas) and feminist/critical narrative (Rainer). Supplementary readings, including many theoretical works by the filmmakers themselves as well as material touching on parallel avant-garde movements in painting, photography, poetry, and music from the same era, works by highly influential artists like Charles Olson, John Cage, et al.

The form is hybrid, traditionally includes the 'voice' of the maker, and operates on multiple discursive levels of political argumentation, intellectual inquiry, social engagement and artistic innovation. Makers to be discussed include; Renais, Farocki, Marker, Ruiz, Straub and Huillet, E. Baudelaire, Varda, Julien, Sankofa and Steyerl plus many recent works. The class can be taken for film production or film history credit with a different set of requirements to be fulfilled. An ambitious media work is required of the production student, based on a topic of interest raised in the class. The screenings scheduled outside of class time are required and although we will critique students' works-in-progress and raw camera footage, there is no dedicated tech instruction. Class size: 15",

Does art made with, on, or about the internet require new evaluative models? Does the internet change our ideas about art as a whole? Has the internet altered the relationship between the artist, the artwork and the audience? How should internet art be curated and exhibited? How can we distinguish such art from other cultural and creative uses of new technologies? Are we now in a \u2018post-internet\u2019 moment and, if so, what does this mean for art? In this seminar, we will look at historical and contemporary examples of internet art, as well as work from related forms such as literature, cinema and performance. We\u2019ll also read and discuss writers who explore issues relevant to the question of internet aesthetics. Concepts will include interactivity, appropriation, simulation, generative art, identity in networked culture, technological determinism, medium specificity, relational aesthetics, and the question of immateriality. Grades will be based on in-class discussion, writing assignments and a final essay.

We will examine how music has been represented in the past and how it is variously represented today, and will develop ethnographic research and writing skills. We will ask questions about the utility and value of music as a commodity in our everyday lives and in our globalized world. We will debate the ethics of musical appropriations and collaborations. We will examine both the foundational questions of the discipline (addressing debates about musical authenticity, musical origins, universals, comparative frameworks, and the preservationist ethos) as well as recent subjects of ethnomusicological concern. Topics will include: media and technology; post-colonial issues; music and language; hybridity; circulation and consumption; music and labor; music and gender; and the relevance of music to contemporary indigenous politics and human rights. Students are expected to read assigned readings in advance of class, participate in weekly discussions online and in class, take a midterm and final exam, and produce a variety of informal and formal written assignments (ranging from one-paragraph reading responses to two papers that are 5-7 pages in length).

        "department": "music",
        "description": "In the 1920\u2019s, a number of new electronic instruments such as the Theremin, the Ondes Martenot and the Trautonium were invented, and a number of composers, including Hindemith and Messiaen, composed new works for them. After the invention of magnetic recording tape in the late 40\u2019s electronic music became an enterprise that was produced in special studios and fixed on tape for later playback. Starting around 1960, John Cage and David Tudor began experimental performances with such works as Cartridge Music (1960), Variations II and other pieces that reintroduced the live performer to the electronic medium. Many composers, such as Mumma, Behrman, Lucier, Ashley, Stockhausen, Nono, and Boulez, as well as collective improvisationally-based groups such as AMM Music in London, and Musica Elettronica Viva in Rome soon followed suit. During the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s, with the advent of smaller and the more personal synthesizers invented by Moog, Buchla and others, the field of live electronic music became a practical reality. Some ten years later, a similar sequence of events took place with regard to computer music, where the large mainframes of the 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s were superseded by the PC revolution of the late 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s. This was followed by the more recent development of the laptop that has enabled performers to carry powerful, portable computers on stage. This course will trace these developments, examine the literature of the field, encourage live performances of \"classic\" pieces, and the creation and performance of new compositions and improvisations. It is strongly recommended that this course be taken in conjunction with Electro-Acoustic Ensemble. This course counts towards the music history requirement for music majors. Class size: 15",

More compositionally, we will study the wealth of thematic transformation techniques that made late Romanticism such a fluid and often extramusically referential language.

The focus will be on learning the language of color; value, temperature, contrast, saturation, intensity and how color becomes light. Students will also be learning about geometric structures in the rectangle and will concentrate on developing spatial relationships and organizing shapes across the picture plane. Students will work on gessoed paper as well as stretched canvas with oil paint. A limited palette will be used over the first weeks as students become familiar with the process. Most of the work in class will be from life, still-lifes and the figure but there will be projects that involve working from reproductions. This class is about paint, about the physical process of putting paint next to paint, it's not about drawing and filling in and it's not about rendering individual objects. Class time is for work and discussions and critiques will take place during breaks or at the end of the class. Students are expected to attend every class and there will be homework assignments.

The primary goal of this class is to help students locate specific aesthetic territory to explore in a substantive way through a series of open-ended assignments. Each student will be asked to work very independently to ultimately develop a cohesive body of work. Drawing will be integrated into the painting process as an expedient way to address issues or experiment. Students will be expected to challenge themselves in terms of scale and materials to fit the content, aesthetics, and process by which they make their work. Sessions will be divided between critique and work time, augmented by readings. Painting 2 is a prerequisite for this class, or permission of instructor. ",

Through the projects, a diversity of options will be explored in terms of media uses, image versus abstraction, a single drawing versus a series, large versus small, color versus black and white etc. Imagination and experimentation will be encouraged as well as a deepening understanding of how these different drawing options affect the meaning of what is being looked at. Class discussions and critiques will focus on the transformation of the creative impulse into concept and concept into visual realization.

Students develop a series of projects designed to aid them in recognizing, conceptualizing, and articulating their particular artistic interests. Presentations by alumni from the Bard studio arts program provide a glimpse into the future; and, workshops on the photographing of art and website development help the student prepare for life after Bard. Exhibitions in the fall semester will draw students out of their studios well before the presentation of their senior show. Required studio visits from faculty members other than the project advisor insure fresh and varied responses to the ongoing senior project. The Senior Project Exhibition is the culmination of the Senior year and is evaluated before a faculty review board and a Senior Seminar critique. *Any student registered in Studio Art Senior Project or any student of another discipline who has been granted studio space in either the Fisher Studio\nArt Center or the U.B.S. Exhibition Center in Red Hook will be required to register and participate in all aspects of Senior Seminar. Class size: 20",

Paying close attention to connections between drama, stagecraft, and modes of spectatorship, we will ask how the theater has shored up political power; how the stage has served as a scale model for the known world; and what has been at stake in changing notions of classicism.

We will investigate this defining period in American theater, examining artists such as Carolee Schneeman, Valerie Solanas, Amiri Baraka, Charles Ludlam, and Jack Smith; and movements such as early off-off-Broadway, the Black Arts Movement, and Judson Dance. Our study will conclude by examining twenty-first century reenactments of iconic 1960s performances as a means of understanding the deep significance that this decade holds in the American imagination. Assignments will include research papers, presentations and a creative project inspired by the work we study. Class size: 16",

This advanced workshop in devising and adaptation will perform (literally) an examination of the significance and meaning of The Exorcist, created over the semester using historical research, conversations, attempts at re-staging, religious rites, death-metal growls, and head turns of 180 degrees or more. The course will examine the film as an allegory for everything American in the 20th century--specifically contradictory ideas of acting, art, directing and selling out (or buying in)--and will ask what relevance (if any) this style of filmmaking and choice of subject have for the 21st century. Students will engage in extensive research, discussion, and creation, both individually and in groups. Class size: 14",

What does it mean to turn into someone else? How total is the transformation? What are the implications for our understanding of the individual? Various texts, from the acting primers of Stanislavski and Strasberg to works of literary criticism, natural science, cognitive psychology, and philosophy of mind will be considered, alongside acting exercises and projects that attempt to examine what \"realism\" means in the 21st century. The seminar will culminate in a final project in which participants turn into each other. Students will be assigned weekly readings and presentations, and/or weekly exercises. These exercises will sometimes involve working with a collaborator. Class size: 14",

We will ask why some new versions have become iconic in their own right, and what makes for a particularly successful adaptation, addressing the constraints, norms, and cultural connotations of each medium. Using A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream as our primary source text we will unpack Shakespeare\u2019s dramatic strategies (such as juxtaposition, comic tropes and conventions, extremity, fantasy) and examine existing adaptations (films, poetry, graphic novels, plays, musicals, television.) We will also create our own contemporary responses to the play in a variety of genres, which we will both write and perform. Admission by application. Applications are welcome from upper-level students with substantial backgrounds in writing, theater, dance, music, or studio arts. To apply, send a cover letter, resum\u00e9, and 5-10 page creative writing sample, to: theaterapp@bard.edu by midnight on May 1, 2015.

When a literary work is composed, who is it who composes it? To what extent does such a work represent the general culture out of which it emerged, and to what extent does it reflect an individual consciousness? How does our assumption of who the author is affect how our reading of the text? We will be keeping these questions in mind as we examine the shift in medieval and Renaissance literature from epic to lyric and romance; from orally-based literature to written texts; and from anonymous poets to professional writers. Texts to be read will include The Song of Roland, troubadour lyrics, Arthurian romances, The Romance of the Rose, Dante's Inferno, Petrarch\u2019s sonnets, Boccaccio\u2019s Decameron, Christine de Pizan's Book of the City of Ladies, and Francois Villon's Testament.

Our discussions will begin by examining the dialogue between poetry and the other arts of the Baroque, especially the music of Bach and the sculpture of Bernini. Then our focus will be on how principal literary debates (e.g., the quarrel of the ancients and moderns, the aesthetic attitudes of the New Science, the Encyclopedia project, and the emergence of modern feminism) shaped some of the profound historical and cultural changes of the age. As part of our sustained reflection on the role and reach and poetry, we will also examine the critique of Enlightenment rationality and rhetoric in the Age of Sensibility and Storm and Stress movements. A final goal will be to consider how the idea of \"literature\" itself underwent changes in the 17th and 18th centuries that reflected the complex attitudes toward modernity in this period of scientific, cultural, and political revolution. Authors will include Descartes, Vico, Voltaire, Mme de Graffigny, Rousseau, Goethe, and Wollstonecraft; as well as their recent critics Adorno, Culler, Eagleton, Habermas, and Said. Class size: 22",

Other texts will include Chaucer\u2019s Canterbury Tales,The Book of Margery Kempe, medieval religious and morality plays, More\u2019s Utopia, Elizabethan sonnets, and Marlowe\u2019s Doctor Faustus.

Kaplan, \"are a region of pure memory: a Bosch-like tapestry of interlocking ethnic rivalries where medieval and modern history thread into each other.\" Indeed, the countries of the Balkan Peninsula, or \"Stara Planina\" (\"Old Mountain\" in Bulgarian) are often seen as especially \"savage,\" \"primitive,\" \"dark\" and \"violent\" in comparison with the more \"civilized\" West. In this course, relying on Maria Todorova\u2019s Imagining the Balkans and Vesna Goldsworthy\u2019s Inventing Ruritania to frame questions and provoke discussion, we will read fiction, nonfiction and poetry from Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Macedonia, Montenegro, Romania and Serbia that explores past and present as represented by Balkan writers themselves. During the first half of the course we will concentrate on the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when the struggle for liberation from the five-hundred year \"Turkish Yoke\" led in turn to the lasting enmities of the Balkan Wars and varied Balkan participation in World War II. For the second half we will examine writing that has come out of the fall of communist regimes since 1989, and the wars provoked by the breakup of the former Yugoslavia. Authors include but are not limited to Ismail Kadare (Albania), Ivan Vazov, Vladislav Todorov (Bulgaria), Miroslav Krle\u017ea, Slavenka Draculic, Dubravka Ugre\u015di\u0107 (Croatia), C.P. Cavafy (Greece), Tashko Georgievski (Macedonia), Ivo Andri\u0107, Danilo Ki\u0161 (Serbia), Gregor von Rezzori, Herta Muller (Romania). Bosnian-American writers T\u00e9a Obreht and Aleksandar Hemon are also included, with supplementary readings from such Western writers as Rebecca West, Robert D. Kaplan, and Misha Glenny.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Environmental & Urban Studies; Literature; Russian & Eurasian Studies Emperors, serfs, merchants, and soldiers built St. Petersburg, but it was the writers who put it on the cultural map of the world. Founded on the outskirts of the empire, the city served as a missing link between \"enlightened\" Europe and \"barbaric\" Asia, between the turbulent past of the Western civilization and its uncertain future. Considered to be too cold, too formal, too imperial on the outside, St. Petersburg harbored revolutionary ideas and terrorist movements that threatened to explode from within. While its granite quays were erected to withstand the assault of the floods, some of its most famous monuments, including literary works, resisted the onset of new, radical ideologies. In this course, we will study the conflicting nature of the city as reflected in literature and literary criticism. The poems and novels on our reading list will provide a sweeping overview of Russia\u2019s literary canon in the 19th and 20th centuries, from Pushkin to Dostoevsky and from Gogol to Bely and Nabokov. After exploring Queen of Spades, Crime and Punishment, and Anna Karenina, we will move on to Petersburg and The Defense, thus undertaking a journey through Russia\u2019s literary tradition and the urban landscape of the north with the authors who either reconstructed St. Petersburg in their memory or re-visited it in their imaginations.

And what can this effort to represent injustice, suffering, or resistance tell us about about fiction and literature? This course will focus on a wide range of fictions, from a variety of writers with different backgrounds, that tell unusual stories about the rights of individuals and communities to justice. We will read novels addressing human migration, injustices committed in the name of the state against a minority, and the harsh conditions under which some communities operate as part of their survival strategy, among other topics. We will look at the ways in which literary forms can allow universalizing claims to be made, exploring how racism, disenfranchisement, poverty, and lack of access to education and health care, for instance, can affect the dignity of all humans. Readings may include: Chronicles of a Death Foretold by Garcia Marquez; Snow Falling on Cedars by David Guterson; Smilla\u2019s Sense of Snow by Peter Hoeg; Our Nig by Harriet Wilson; Balzac & the Chinese Seamstress by Sijai Dai; Winter is in the Blood by James Welch ; The Way to Rainy Mountain by N. Scott Momaday; Wolves of the Crescent Moon by Yousef Al-Mohaimeed, and Bound to Violence by Yambo\nOuleguem. We will also watch a number of films based on the novels (including Chronicles, Smilla's Sense, Balzac, Snow Falling), and The First Grader (2001, on the right to education in Kenya).

When they are pushed out of or flee their native countries, they can be legally described as \"refugees,\" but there are many others who leave their homes fearing death or detention and are turned into \"exiles.\" Today nearly 40 million people are counted as refugees or 'internally displaced people.'Hannah Arendt described stateless people as \"the most symptomatic group in contemporary politics,\" and this seminar will explore some of the factors underlying displacement and some of the responses -- especially literary -- to it. We will ask about the experience of eviction and movement, and about the meaning of refuge. Although we will be attentive to political and social dimensions of the refugee experience, our focus will be on imaginative reflections on and accounts of displacement, flight, and (re)settlement. Among the texts considered will be: Aleksander Hemon's Nowhere Man, Tahar Ben Jelloun's The Blinding Absence of Light, Leila Abouleila's Minaret, Goethe's Conversation with Germand Refugees, Jean Marteilhe's Galley Slave, Robin Gwynn's Hugenot Heritage.

Clandestine murders, otherworldly revenants, disguise, madness, and a final scene of brutal bloodshed: these characterize the revenge tragedy, a form of drama extremely popular in Elizabethan and Jacobean England. Revenge tragedies function not only as a form of social critique - they also speak to the anxieties and wonder that accompanied new modes of understanding the physical world, human emotion, and individual accountability. We\u2019ll begin by investigating the early modern revenge tragedy\u2019s antecedent, Senecan tragedy, before moving to consider the emergence of the revenge tragedy in its own context during the late-16th and early-17th centuries. Titles will include: The Spanish Tragedy, The Revenger's Tragedy, Titus Andronicus, 'Tis Pity She's a Whore, The Duchess of Malfi, and The Changeling. Finally, we shall examine modern instantiations of the genre - such as A History of Violence, Park Chan-Wook's Vengeance Trilogy, Pynchon's The Crying of Lot 49, and The Cook, The Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover - to consider how these pieces pay homage to and deviate from their forebears.

We will begin by identifying impulses in Emerson\u2019s writing (individualism, self-creation, pragmatism, languages of movement and becoming, aesthetic religion) and examine their development in thinkers like William James, John Dewey, F.S. Fitzgerald, Richard Rorty, and Stanley Cavell, as well as critiques from George Santayana, Joan Scott, and others. Jonathan Edwards will be the point of departure for the Protestant tradition, and we will trace its concerns (original sin and the tragic sense, the transcendence of justice, the imperatives of ethical reform) through the writings of Jane Addams, William Faulkner, Reinhold Niebuhr, and Martin Luther King, Jr. We will consider the criticism of this tradition in writers like H.L. Menken, and examine the transference of moral and emotional authority from American Protestantism to the domains of psychoanalysis and social science (Philip Rieff, Norman O. Brown, Margaret Mead). Finally, beginning with Walt Whitman, we will investigate conceptualizations and critiques of American pluralism and egalitarianism as they develop through the writings of Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Randolph Bourne, W.E.B.

However, the intention here is not to try and answer this question but rather to interrogate and problematize it, by examining how this region has been historically produced as an \"other\" by the West and why such ideas continue to have currency in the contemporary moment. Beginning with 19th century orientalism and European colonialism, this course will trace the development of representations of the \"orient\" in a range of literary, artistic and cinematic production. Whether it is the licentious sheikh with his exotic harem, the suicide bomber promised seven virgins in the afterlife, or the oil-rich businessman, certain images have dominated the Western imagining of the \"Orient.\" Through an interdisciplinary approach, we will unpack some of these representations, situating them with a larger historical and political context. We will consider how the region has been gendered and sexualized from Flaubert to \"Sex and the City.\" We will also consider the ways in which such representations have been internalized and reproduced in the region. Additional themes covered in the course will include travelers and travel writing, biblical landscapes, imagined oil fields, and fatwas and fanatics. Readings will include Edward Said, Edward   Lane, Alan Nidel, Ella Shohat and Jack Shaheen. Class size: 15",

But the tendency to critique the present by imagining a darkly extrapolated future surely extends back much further \u2013 and grew in prevalence and popularity until the twentieth became the veritable dystopic century. Today central components of dystopian satire -- global climate destruction, nuclear annihilation, terrorist states \u2013 have become commonplaces of our politics. In such a world has dystopia become prophetic, or redundant? In this seminar we will grapple with that question, as we explore the literature of dystopia present and past, plumbing increasingly murky visions of destruction to come. Authors whose work we will read include Margaret Atwood, J.G. Ballard, Anthony Burgess, William Burroughs, Philip K. Dick, P.D.

We will also question the narrative and stylistic function of homosexuality, discuss the significance of the massive social disruption brought about by the Great War and investigate why the visual arts and music are seminal to the narration.

We will explore both the great diversity of voices, styles, and forms employed in these narratives as well as the cultural, historical, political, and philosophical issues they chronicle. Particular emphasis will be placed on analysis of fiction by some of the groundbreaking practitioners of the form, including Cormac McCarthy, William Gaddis, Angela Carter, Jeanette Winterson, Kazuo Ishiguro, David Foster Wallace, Robert Coover, Ian McEwan, and Jamaica Kincaid. Joyce Carol Oates, Peter Straub, and Brian Evenson will visit class to talk with students about their books and writing process, and read from recent work. Class size: 15",

        "department": "lit3courses",
        "description": "This course is centered around American literary texts produced between (roughly) 1865 and 1914, by a variety of writers seeking to convey the \"realities\" of American life and culture in this turbulent period. A conventional understanding of Realism has, for many years, been defined by the works of James, Howells, Twain, Crane, Dreiser, Wharton, and Chopin---a handful of writers whose influential and significant contributions to the aesthetic movement of Realism are uncontested, but whose positionality (especially as white, privileged, and, for the most part, male) severely limited their ability to record, shape, or criticize the diverse whole of \"real\" American life. Alongside works by these writers, then, we will also examine texts by writers of color, of varying ethnicities, and by greater numbers of women, in order to access and better understand the different realities they were striving to document and influence. Texts by Zitkala-Sa, Charles Chesnutt, W.E.B. DuBois, James Weldon Johnson, and Sui Sin Far---whose contributions are now, finally, garnering attention as responsive to and constitutive of a larger Realist aesthetic---flesh out our shared reading list, enriching and complicating our encounters with American languages, stories, and forms. In addition to the course readings, students will work closely with essays in contemporary criticism to analyze how current scholars wrangle with problems of defining Realism and its offshoots, among them Naturalism and Regionalism. A variety of writing assignments will afford us the opportunity to consider how small groups of texts converse about Realism\u2019s major themes and preoccupations. This course is cross-listed with the MAT program for 3+2 students in literature. Class size: 10",

        "description": "Over the past several decades the critical boundaries between literary novels and genre fiction have become\u2014as the result of ambitious work by various innovative, pioneering writers\u2014increasingly ambiguous. The earliest gothicists framed their tales within the metaphoric scapes of ruined abbeys and diabolic grottoes, chthonic settings populated by protagonists whose inverted psyches led them to test the edges of propriety and sanity. Masters such as Angela Carter, William Gaddis, and Cormac McCarthy, while embracing this same fundamentally dark artistic vision, have radically reinvented and contemporized tropes, settings, and narrative arcs to create a new phase in this historic tradition. This movement, identified as the New Gothic, appears to have risen in tandem with a parallel literary phenomenon, which for the purposes of this course is termed New Wave Fabulism, whose achievement is to have taken the genre of fantasy/horror in a similar literary direction. While not breaking allegiance with the fundamental spirit that animates its genre counterparts, writers such as John Crowley, Kelly Link, and Elizabeth Hand are creating a body of serious literary fiction that deserves critical examination. Among others we will read are Robert Coover, Brian Evenson, Karen Russell, and Peter Straub. One or two authors will join us in class to discuss their work with students and give a reading. ",

Rather than thinking of structure as an imposition, this workshop considers it an aid to the freeing of the imagination. Along the way, students encounter such aspects of poetic form as patterns of repetition; the infinite varieties of syntax, punctuation, meter, and typography; the \"color\" of vowels; and the rhythmic implications of word choice and sentence structure. Participants explore a range of techniques and materials from around the world and from the beginning of recorded history right up to the present moment.

Throughout the semester, we will discuss the mechanics of literary community building, from submitting, interning, blogging, tweeting (one recent editor of The Paris Review Daily maintains a Twitter feed about all things Pym), forming literary chat rooms and real-life book clubs. We will consider strategies for sustainable engagement with the reading and writing students have cherished at Bard, extending into their twenties and far beyond.

Emphasis will be on demystifying the project process, including its bureaucratic hurdles, as well as exploring the role of research in the creative realm, and helping students use each other as a critical and inspirational resource during this protracted solitary endeavor, sharing works in progress when appropriate. This will supplement but never supplant the primary and sacrosanct role of the project adviser. Program faculty and alumni, career development and other staff, and outside speakers (such as editors, translators, MFA graduates and directors, publishing personnel, etc.) will all contribute their collective wisdom and experience, sharing the myriad ways in which writers move an idea toward full creative realization and giving a glimpse of the kinds of internships and careers available to the writer.

We will begin with the beginnings of recorded civilization in the Near East about 7000 BCE and will move fairly quickly through the Neolithic period, to the urban revolution of the third millennium (early Bronze Age). The focus then will sharpen to the Mediterranean basin: Greece (c.1600-320 BCE) and Rome (c. 600 BCE-430 CE). The main emphasis of the course will be on these latter two cultures and understanding how they came to be shaped in quite different and distinctive ways. We will also, however, focus on the chronological and causal sweep of ancient Mediterranean culture as a whole, from its first beginnings to the death of St. Augustine, with the Vandals storming the gates of Carthage. We will look at underlying features of geography and demography, archaeology (and how to read archaeological remains historically), developments in technology and trade, religion, politics, family organization, communities and governments, art and literacy -- and we will try to consider how all these different kinds of causally-linked factors come together in different ways, at different points in the chronological and geographical continuum of the ancient Mediterranean world.

Written while Rome was in the midst of a new foundation under Augustus, Livy\u2019s work contributed to a vigorous contemporary debate\u2014shared by fellow writers such as Virgil, Propertius, and Ovid\u2014about Roman origins. In addition to our careful reading of the Latin, emphasis will be placed on developing a range of critical approaches to Livy\u2019s text.

Although we will read several texts commonly included in the canon of the Querelle, this course is not meant to be a survey of this specific historical conflict, but rather a broader exploration of the roles played by the past, the present and the future in the creation and reception of works of literature in the French tradition. We will focus on several authorial oppositions (Corneille/Racine, Voltaire/Rousseau, Balzac/Flaubert, Sartre/Blanchot), oppositions which each time restate the place of literature on the temporal spectrum.

As Victor Hugo\u2019s age of lyric romanticism came to an end, these poets took full measure of a modern subjectivity in crisis by making it a crisis of form, with increasing disenchantment, irony, self-reflexivity, and obscurity. Their challenge to figurative language ultimately brought poetry dangerously close to silence, madness or death. We will, through a succession of close readings, assess the range of this poetic revolution, one that constantly questioned the limits of literature and the very possibility of meaning. Taught in French. Primary texts in French, secondary sources in English. Readings include Les Fleurs du Mal and Le Spleen de Paris (Baudelaire), Illuminations and Une Saison en enfer (Rimbaud), Poesies (Mallarm\u00e9). Class size: 18",

In this course, we shall explore the interconnections between politics, art, and social life through manifold literary texts (e.g. D\u00f6blin, Nabokov, Baudelaire, Poe), major theoretical writings (e.g. Benjamin, de Certeau, Aug\u00e9, Young), as well as through films (e.g. Berlin: Symphony of a Great City, Triumph of Will, Run Lola Run), architecture (Hitler's and Speer's plans for \"Germania\"), memorials (Holocaust memorial, Jewish Museum), and other visual art works (e.g. by Kollwitz, Grosz, street art). Our scrutiny of the significant changes in Berlin over the past century will focus on two historical thresholds: Around 1930, when the totalitarian regimes in Europe emerged, and around 1989, when this \"age of the extremes\" seems to come to an end, and our contemporary period with its compelling developments begins. Berlin can thus be called, in adaptation of Walter Benjamin's expression about Paris' significance for the 19th century, the capital of the 20th century. - Taught in English. Class size: 18",

We will investigate the evolution and the various facets of this experience as it manifests itself in literature through a close reading of selected works (novels, novellas, poems, and plays) by Grillparzer, Nestroy, Grabbe, Hebbel, Heine, Morike, Droste-Hulshoff, Keller, Stifler, C.F.

The heterogeneous aspects of the Italian cultural field after WWII are considered in a wide-ranging framework, in which postwar histories are informed not simply by the external context of the Cold War but also by preceding wartime discourses. The course encompasses the ideological debate of the late 1940s, the role of aesthetics in reshaping the national self (Neorealism and its discontents), and the politics of memory enacted by literature and film (Italo Calvino, Curzio Malaparte, Carlo Levi). It also investigates the legacy of violence left by Fascism and the war, the trauma of national defeat, and Italian responsibility in WWII and the Holocaust (Primo Levi, Rosetta Loy).

Founded on the outskirts of the empire, the city served as a missing link between \"enlightened\" Europe and \"barbaric\" Asia, between the turbulent past of the Western civilization and its uncertain future. Considered to be too cold, too formal, too imperial on the outside, St. Petersburg harbored revolutionary ideas and terrorist movements that threatened to explode from within. While its granite quays were erected to withstand the assault of the floods, some of its most famous monuments, including literary works, resisted the onset of new, radical ideologies. In this course, we will study the conflicting nature of the city as reflected in literature and literary criticism. The poems and novels on our reading list will provide a sweeping overview of Russia\u2019s literary canon in the 19th and 20th centuries, from Pushkin to Dostoevsky and from Gogol to Bely and Nabokov. After exploring Queen of Spades, Crime and Punishment, and Anna Karenina, we will move on to Petersburg and The Defense, thus undertaking a journey through Russia\u2019s literary tradition and the urban landscape of the north with the authors who either reconstructed St. Petersburg in their memory or re-visited it in their imaginations.

We will develop a critical vocabulary that will provide the foundation for close readings and in-depth literary analysis, and will spend considerable time working on developing skills for writing analytical essays in Spanish. The semester will be devoted to engaging with four literary genres: poetry, narrative, drama, and essays. The authors on our reading list will include many of the primary writers from Spain and Latin America, whose works span the vast historical period from the middle ages and the Spanish American colony to contemporary times. This is not meant to be a survey of all literary periods, however. Our focus will be on acquiring the basic skills for literary analysis. Conducted in Spanish. Class size: 18",

Variations in reactivity are discussed to illustrate the differential reactivity of similar functional groups and how these differences may be used in selectivity. Fairly complicated syntheses are evaluated to appreciate new ideas and approaches to synthesis.

We will start with a survey of the most compelling lines of evidence for climate change, how they are obtained/derived and some of their limitations. We will then discuss in some depth idealized one-dimensional planetary radiative and thermal balance, first in the absence of an atmosphere, and then in the presence of a radiatively active one, with variable number of layers. In this context, it will become interesting to explore atmospheric opacity with respect to various radiative types, and what natural and anthropogenic effects affect this opacity. A related topic will be natural feedbacks, such as water vapor and could feedbacks. We will next place current (modern) observations of climate change in the broader context of past climates, emphasizing the last couple millennia,hundreds of millennia, and finally the ten million-year scale geological record. We will conclude the course with some discussion about the objective of successful policy mitigation efforts, and their implementation obstacles. While not technical per se, participation in this course does require the ability to solve a couple of linear algebraic equations (like solving x + 4 = 2y and 2x - 3y = 6 for x and y) and to perform some very basic manipulation of data and plot the results (using, e.g., Microsoft's Excel).

Particular attention is given to such figures as James, Pavlov, Freud, Skinner and Asch, to mention just a few. Illumination will also come from a consideration of correspondence between and among pivotal individuals in the field. Critical analyses and integrations are juxtaposed with historical renderings. Upper college students likely will benefit from this course because they already possess the foundational knowledge necessary to draw comparisons and critically evaluate varying points of view. Lower college students likely will use the course to greet the intellectual domains they enter. Class size: 22",

The ubiquitous (and often intrusive) nature of these advertisements invokes the sentiments of Will Rogers who once said, \"advertising is the art of convincing people to spend money they don\u2019t have for something they don\u2019t need.\" However, at their core, advertisements are designed to persuade an audience to take an action. For example, a recent advertising campaign funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is widely credited with helping over 100,000 people quit smoking. To influence consumer behavior, an advertisement must attract attention, leave a lasting memory trace, change preferences, and ultimately impact decision-making. In other words, creating a successful advertisement requires an understanding of how the mind works. In this course, students will learn the psychological principles underlying advertising strategies and how these influence consumer behavior. Class size: 22",

From annoying tip-of-the-tongue moments to more embarrassing (or worse) memory lapses, forgetting is a regular\u2014and sometimes even advantageous\u2014occurrence. But we still have a lot learn about exactly how and why these episodes occur. In this seminar, we will consider leading psychological and neuroscientific theories of forgetting, as well as the empirical evidence for them. Do memories simply decay over time or is interference to blame? Can memories be repressed only later to be recovered? How do drugs, alcohol, and traumatic head injuries affect memory consolidation? By the end of the course, you will have acquired the scientific background necessary to address these questions in relation to forgetting in your own life, as well as notorious cases of memory failures in the public sphere.

Children undergo enormous changes in their thinking in the years before they enter school, and these changes have alternately been described as continuous and discontinuous, qualitative and quantitative in nature. In particular, a large amount of research has targeted children\u2019s \"theory of mind\", or the understanding that outward behaviors are caused by internal states (thoughts, beliefs), and not necessarily the actual state of affairs. Does a 3-year old understand that two people can have different perceptions of the same experience? When do children realize that thoughts and dreams can\u2019t be touched, the way a toy can?

Students examine the reasons for this failure to deal moreeffectively with these conditions as they study various specific diseases. Examples include inherited diseases such assickle-cell anemia, Huntington's disease, and cystic fibrosis; endocrine disorders such as acromegaly; nutrional disorderssuch as vitamin and mineral deficiencies; therapeutic drug addiction and toxicities; various poisonings such as plantintoxications and rattlesnake envenomation; cardiovascular diseases such as myocardial infarctions and cerebrovascularaccidents; neurological diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease; allergies; and autoimmune diseasessuch as myasthenia gravis, multiple sclerosis, and diabetes mellitus. Many of the readings are relatively nontechnical casehistories, but the biology underlying each condition is thoroughly developed. This course is of interest to those focusingon a career in the health professions, but is also designed to provide liberal arts students with some degree of medicalliteracy in these health issues. The laboratory portion introduces students to human physiology as it relates to disease.Prerequisites: experience in high school biology and chemistry.",

We will consider ways to listen deeply and to write critically about music. We will examine how music has been represented in the past and how it is variously represented today, and will develop ethnographic research and writing skills. We will ask questions about the utility and value of music as a commodity in our everyday lives and in our globalized world. We will debate the ethics of musical appropriations and collaborations. We will examine both the foundational questions of the discipline (addressing debates about musical authenticity, musical origins, universals, comparative frameworks, and the preservationist ethos) as well as recent subjects of ethnomusicological concern. Topics will include: media and technology; post-colonial issues; music and language; hybridity; circulation and consumption; music and labor; music and gender; and the relevance of music to contemporary indigenous politics and human rights. Students are expected to read assigned readings in advance of class, participate in weekly discussions online and in class, take a midterm and final exam, and produce a variety of informal and formal written assignments (ranging from one-paragraph reading responses to two papers that are 5-7 pages in length).

This course will explore medical knowledge and practice in a variety of healing systems including that of western biomedicine, focusing on the human body as the site where illness is experienced, and upon which social meanings and political actions are inscribed.

We draw on research from the United States, South Africa, Australia, Sudan, France, Togo, Cameroon, Syria, Germany, Indonesia, Egypt, England, Gaza, and Venezuela. We begin with foundational theories of the state (e.g. Marx, Weber, Arendt, Althusser, Foucault, Bourdieu). We then turn to ethnographic cases to investigate the unlikely relationships between phenomena such as corruption, borders, railroads, the standardization of time, nuclear power, bureaucracies, forest fires and science, on the one hand, and the effects, and meanings, of statehood and state-making in the modern world, on the other. How do institutions, practices and people come to appear like a state in the first place? What networks and what processes of representation allow us to call states \"green,\" \"militarized,\" \"neoliberal,\" \"socialist\" or \"police\" states? How do we know when a state has become \"post-colonial\"? In asking these questions we will assume that environmental conditions, scientific practices and military technologies that help uphold state apparatuses are sociotechnical objects (per Bruno Latour), and can sometimes be manipulated by, forces we usually think of as distinctly political, economic, cultural or social. We will conclude with an examination of a question inspired by the recent political mobilizations in Ferguson, M.O.

As people around the world engage on a daily (and even hourly) basis with a variety of different media and technology, humanities scholars have turned their attention to ways new and old media shape people\u2019s perception of time, space, publicity, knowledge, social and personal identity. Just as culture is being reshaped by everyday media practices, media itself has reshaped our idea of culture and humanity. The premise of this course is that the new-ness of new media can only be approached against the background of humanistic experimentation and imagination with both old and new media. Drawing on key media theorists, such as, Walter Benjamin, Fredrick Kittler, Marshall McLuhen, Donna Haraway, Katherine Hayles, Henry Jenkins, and others, we will examine topics that include \"old media\" like money and writing/print culture, as well as the rise of electronic media like the motion picture, radio, and digital media - what Jenkins has called the \"convergence culture\" of today. As part of our ongoing examinations of how material conditions shape discourse, we will assess our own positions as users, consumers, and potential producers of media. This course fulfills a requirement for the Experimental Humanities concentration, and will involve a \"practice\" component that complements our engagement with media theory. ",

How is \u2018home\u2019 configured in relation to foreign places in these texts? Using Jamaica Kincaid\u2019s A Small World, we will also examine some of the ethical dilemmas that tourism in particular poses: what impact does the traveler have on the communities they visit? We will then discuss travel as a rite of passage that depends on a person\u2019s absence from their home environment and provides a space that ostensibly is transformative, as in ritual pilgrimages, the Victorian Grand Tour, anthropological fieldwork or the post-college backpacking trip. Finally, we will consider the writings from exile or diaspora communities that challenge the master narrative of European travel from the \u2018center\u2019 to the \u2018periphery\u2019.

The course examines the debate over the \"problem of race\" in its early formulation shaped by scientific racism and eugenics, especially the fear of degeneration. It then turns to the Brazilian policy of the 19th and early 20th centuries of branquemento (whitening) which was the basis of large-scale migration to Brazil from all major regions of Europe. These \"ethnic\" populations settled mainly in southern and south central Brazil leading to significant regional differences in identity politics and racial attitudes. The interplay of \"racial\" vs. \"ethnic\" identities is crucial to understanding the allocation of resources and status in Brazilian society. Inequality in contemporary Brazil is explored in terms of the dynamics of racial ideologies, the distribution of national resources and the performance of identity as shaped by \"racial\" and \"ethnic\" strategies, and recent government policies. The groups to be discussed are: indigenous/native Brazilians, the Luso-Brazilians, Japanese Brazilians, Euro-ethic Brazilians, and Brazilians of Arab and Jewish descent. Class size: 20",

        "department": "economics",
        "description": "In the fall of 2008 financial systems worldwide became engulfed in a financial crisis of extraordinary proportions. Despite the intervention of global authorities, trillions of dollars in financial wealth disappeared, almost overnight. In the half a decade since, most developed countries have experienced lackluster economic growth, which have also impacted social conditions. All this has happened before and, most certainly, will happen again. The purpose of this course is to provide students with an introduction to some of the causes and effects of historical episodes of financial crisis. We will find that while certain similarities do exist, no two financial crises are exactly the same; that is, generating from the same causes, or creating the same economic effects, or being resolved in the same manner. Reviewing approximately four centuries of financial crisis through the examination of historical sources written by individuals living through the crises themselves, as well as subsequent scholarly and popular studies, we will develop a historically-based understanding of the impact of financial crisis upon social and economic conditions. In the course of our historical investigation into the causes and effects of financial crisis, we will attempt to answer such key questions as: Are financial crises themselves unavoidable? And, if not, what are the policy options available to authorities in the mitigation and resolution of financial crises. Class size: 22",

In order to meet the last objective, we will devote most of the weekly \"lab\" sessions toward problem solving. During the lab sessions, students are expected to take turns explaining how to solve a particular problem to the rest of the class.

The second part of the class is devoted to post-WWII Europe: reconstruction, the golden age, communism / socialism, the 80s turn around, Maastricht and the Euro, and the European crisis. The questions addressed include: What lessons does the Roman Empire teach us? What was the role of agriculture and urbanization in medieval Europe? Why did the Industrial Revolution take place in Britain, and not elsewhere? Why were some countries \"no-shows\", or very slow, to join the development bandwagon? What are the economic motivations, and consequences, of wars? How do institutions and government interventions frame economic growth? How important is international trade for Europe? What opportunities and challenges do natural resources (or lack thereof) pose? How did the European Union and the Eurozone come to be? Can present-day Europe overcome its challenges? The course is designed for inquiring minds who wish to understand how Europe came to be the major economic area it is now. Our approach is interdisciplinary (history, sociology, politics, geography, institutions\u2026); however we will insist on their economic aspect. Class size: 22",

Some experts estimate the \"unfunded entitlements\" due largely to Social Security and Medicare to total many tens of trillions of dollars. Many young people today fear that Social Security will go bankrupt long before they will reach retirement age. Costs of medical care continue to grow faster than GDP. The Global Financial Crisis wiped out trillions of dollars of pension fund reserves. Will we be able to take care of growing numbers of seniors? If Social Security fails, will you have to support your own parents? Will you be able to accumulate enough retirement savings to see you through your \"golden years\"?

ECE views the economy as \"an open subsystem of a larger ecosystem that is finite, nongrowing, and materially closed (though open with respect to solar energy).\" As human population and production grow, say proponents, ECE is \"a necessary evolution of economic thought\" (Daly and Farley). The positive analyses of ECE are motivated by three normative social goals: (1) efficient allocation of scarce resources, including those\u2014such as ecosystem services\u2014that do not pass through markets; (2) justice in distribution; and (3) an ecologically sustainable scale of economic activity.

More and more income goes to capital-owners and profits, not workers and labor, and since 2000, 95% of income gains have gone to the top 1%. There is much uncertainty regarding the causes and consequences of those trends, and the potential economic policies required. What explains this shift in the distribution of income? What are the roles of technology, international trade, finance, institutions and governance? Why has growth become so biased towards the very few? Is there a tradeoff between growth and equity? Through what processes is income created and distributed? What are extractive and predatory governments? Is inequality bad and if so, why? Is there such a thing as a balanced, or equitable growth and if so, what does it take? This course surveys landmark theories of economic growth and income distribution and is research-based, through the reading of state-of-the-art journal articles and the writing of a term paper. A substantial component of the course involves data procurement and analysis and in-class work on laptops. We focus on the United States and provide international comparisons.

We will begin with the beginnings of recorded civilization in the Near East about 7000 BCE and will move fairly quickly through the Neolithic period, to the urban revolution of the third millennium (early Bronze Age). The focus then will sharpen to the Mediterranean basin: Greece (c.1600-320 BCE) and Rome (c. 600 BCE-430 CE). The main emphasis of the course will be on these latter two cultures and understanding how they came to be shaped in quite different and distinctive ways. We will also, however, focus on the chronological and causal sweep of ancient Mediterranean culture as a whole, from its first beginnings to the death of St. Augustine, with the Vandals storming the gates of Carthage. We will look at underlying features of geography and demography, archaeology (and how to read archaeological remains historically), developments in technology and trade, religion, politics, family organization, communities and governments, art and literacy -- and we will try to consider how all these different kinds of causally-linked factors come together in different ways, at different points in the chronological and geographical continuum of the ancient Mediterranean world.

What role have various types of texts played in Jewish culture, and what is their relationship to lived Jewish experience?

Yet the reality of American history belies this myth. The nation\u2019s history is transnational and yet we focus mostly on its Anglophone roots, ignoring that the \"U.S.\" was carved out of the contests of many empires and grew on internationally based forced labor regimes. It is a story of individuals, alone and/or together, contesting, reacting towards, rejecting, influencing, and embracing the changing notions of what \"the United States\" and \"America\" were from the sixteenth century well into the nineteenth century. The course focuses on six moments that definitively challenged and shaped conceptions of \"American identity\", \"citizen\", and \"the United   States\": the early colonial period, the Constitutional Convention, Cherokee Removal, the era of the internal slave trade and the \"Market Revolution\", the Mexican-American War, and Reconstruction.

The course covers major topics in Ottoman history, including the empire\u2019s origins, its Islamic and European identities, everyday life under the Ottomans, inter-communal relations, the challenge of separatist movements (Balkan, Greek, Arab) and the emergence of modern Turkish nationalism.

In an era of increasing globalization individuals are more likely to emigrate to distant shores, although this is in fact a longstanding historical phenomenon. Homelands in turn have taken on multiple, complex meanings in the imaginations and lived experience of migrant populations, particularly in recent times as technological and transportation innovations facilitate the maintenance of links with native lands. In this course we will read recent theoretical works on Diaspora and then examine case studies of diasporic populations from ancient times to the present. We will inquire about the extent to which Diaspora is celebrated or lamented, how this attitude affects real and imagined ties to homelands. While our focus will be chiefly on diasporic peoples themselves, we will examine the perspective of native/homeland populations on such issues as well. Case studies will include the first and longest-lived diasporic minority group, the Jewish people; black African-descended people since the trans-Atlantic slave trade; and Chinese and South Asian migrant populations.

This course is a journey across the motley religious landscape of early modern Europe in which the ideas and practices of heretics, infidels, and unbelievers nestled in the spaces where orthodox Catholicism held sway. Periodically, heads of state or household sought to bring order to it; and people \u2013royal subjects, wives, children, servants-- resisted. The 16th and 17th centuries were a time in which religious revolution and new ways of ordering spiritual life exploded in a fashion that no one could have anticipated. In the period we now term \"the Reformations\" Europe would reinvent itself at home and discover itself in the New  World. Also, the power of women as a source of threat and of sectarian strength emerges as a primary site for reformation processes. From the expulsion of Iberian Jews and Muslims to European contact with \"cannabalism,\" from Luther in Germany to Carmelites nuns in Canada, from witchcraft to the cult of Mary, from incantation to exorcism, students will trace the personal stories of real people through Inquisition records, diaries and conversion tales, early pamphlets, and accounts of uprisings. We will look at how radical religious ideologies sustained themselves in the face of official repression and, more challenging still, official approval. Open to first year students. Class size: 22",

In turn, the image and its archiving were critical facets of the continent\u2019s histories of liberation and post-independence. This survey introduces students to the historical development of photography in Africa and the historical use of photographs in the late-nineteenth century to recent times. Divided into five parts, the course begins with different theoretical views on the relationship between photography and history. After a consideration of the photography of the royal courts in North Africa and Christian missionaries in West Africa, the class will shift to the role of photography in the making of independent African nations and their liberation struggles during and after World War II. The course concludes by considering the commodization of African photography at international biennales and its functions for single-party regimes that continue to rule across Sub-Saharan Africa. Key themes include photography\u2019s role in shaping historical knowledge and the representation of Africa and its peoples, the appropriation of image making into African creative practices and daily life, the politics of exhibition and archiving, and the ethics of seeing war and social justice. Students will design a historical photography exhibition, and, over the course of the semester, they will also have the opportunity to interact with leading photography curators, photojournalists and art photographers who have spent time in Africa.

The class will focus on several themes such as the diverse histories of revolutions, their inherent contradictions and often irreconcilable demands as well as the intellectual aspects of these popular political actions. In exploring these themes, we will discuss examples of non-violent revolutions, militant revolts, labor strikes and coups d\u2019etat. Through studying these examples we will consider the structural limitations of these movements. We will also seek to understand how the memory of these moments of intense change informed the recent (ongoing?) revolutionary moment. ",

        "department": "history",
        "description": "Cross-listed: Africana Studies, American Studies, French Studies, Human Rights, LAIS Forced labor, whether indentured or enslaved, underpinned the early modern Atlantic world. Beginning in the early sixteenth century, millions of enslaved Africans and indigenous Americans came to or moved around the Americas. The wide variety of societies bordering the Atlantic that created these zones of interaction became places of contested and changing cultural practice. Peoples of African, Native American, and mixed descent not only struggled to survive in the early modern Atlantic but also to fundamentally shape these new locations as many fought to gain or preserve their freedom. Historians in the last thirty years have demonstrated how the territories bordering this ocean were an English Atlantic, a Dutch Atlantic, a French Atlantic, and an Iberian Atlantic. Yet the actors and agents who shaped or were shaped by Atlantic systems are often hidden in the record by virtue of being indigenous, enslaved, or indentured. Students of history, need to consider why it is important to restore a \"Kongolese,\" \"Cherokee,\" or \"m\u00e9tis\" Atlantic to the established set of European empires that are all-too-often seen to dominate the Atlantic world perspective. This course focuses on the African and indigenous Atlantics, and looks at a world of comparative slave societies in this early modern zone. It considers three important issues: the comparative development of slavery, the methods of resistance, and the processes of emancipation and national formations at the end of the eighteenth century. Studying the differing experiences of Africans around the Atlantic and how they helped to shape the diversity of the colonial experience will enable students to trace the initial development of \"African American\" culture, as well as \"Afro-Brazilian,\" \"Afro-Mexican,\" or \"Afro-Caribbean\" cultures. We will investigate what the implications are of how we write or remember the history of this region and trace the intersections that created race, gender, and class through slave societies. The course will end in the early years of the \"age of emancipations,\" with the most famous of all slave rebellions: the Haitian Revolution. This cataclysmic event gave rise to the world\u2019s first black republic and if the rhetoric of empire ushered in the birth of the \"Atlantic World,\" we live today with the mature, and lasting, effects and memories of these vital interactions.

Scholars have interpreted this idea of the post-colonial as a temporal disjuncture, after colonialism. This class is a course in the reading of theory and the history of theory in Africa, and it will shift away from the temporal understanding of the post-colonial concept in order to conceptualize the postcolonial (without a hyphen) as a theoretical shift and site of engagement over the discourses of colonialism, nationalism, race, and globalization. Drawing from scholars and political theorists from the African continent as well as Subaltern Studies, students will cover the topics of historiography, the relationship of power to knowledge production, and critiques of colonialism, nationalism, and apartheid.

        "description": "Cross-listed: American Studies, Art History For millennia the Hudson\nValley has sustained human communities that exploited the rich resources of the valley to support themselves. Although people continued to earn a living from the land, in the late 1700s the Hudson\nValley began to be prized for its beauty as well as its utility. Elites began to build large country houses surrounded by \"pleasure grounds\" that overlooked the river. The Bard campus comprises three of these estates as well a well as Native American sites and early farms. In this course students will explore the history of the nearby Hudson\nValley in order to produce a collaborative public history exhibit. Who were the early farmers and tenants? What is the history of Tivoli, Red Hook, Rhinebeck, Barrytown? Who built the estates? What inspired them? Who worked them? The goal of the course is for each student to curate an individual exhibit on the topic of his/her choice that contributes to a collaborative on-line exhibit on the history of Bard\u2019s immediate surroundings. Students will research images and narrative content during class time and on field/research trips to nearby archives and historic sites. They will learn to use Dublin Core metadata standards and Omeka open source online exhibit-building software. (This exhibit will build upon previous student work at http://omekalib.bard.edu/exhibits/show/before_bard.) The completion of the exhibit constitutes the primary work of this course. Students will need a laptop. Class size:\n15",

        "department": "history",
        "description": "Cross-listed: German Studies In this research course, we will address the coercive and violent powers of the modern state as they were refined through technologies and techniques in National Socialist Germany, and then alternately condemned and utilized in the two German nations of the (East) German Democratic Republic (DDR) and the (West) German Federal Republic (BRD). Topics will range from the development of new techniques of propaganda and military oversight to the manipulation of social technologies such as identification papers, the census, racial pseudo-science, and, most horrifically, the concentration camp system. At the end of the Nazi period, the DDR defined itself through its resistance to the Nazi party, and nearly the entirety of its ideology was grounded in anti-Fascism and cosmopolitanism. The means of organizing and controlling society were often directly carried over from the Nazi past. Similarly, the liberal capitalist ideology of the BRD defined itself in complete opposition to the Nazi past, but here as well there were surprising number holdovers from the Nazi era, ranging from the system of registering with the police to the retention of leading bureaucrats. By comparing the two movements, ideologically complete opposites yet organizationally often surprisingly similar, we can address some of the most disturbing issues of modern techniques of social control. Similarly, protests within each system against specific moments of state power \u2013 ranging from issues such as the use of the census and identity cards to methods of police surveillance and conscription \u2013 were frequently couched in terms of their links with the Nazi era. Please note that the core of this course will be spent writing and refining an independent historical research paper of approximately 35 pages in length. No previous knowledge of German history is required, although students without such knowledge will need to set aside time for some background reading. Class size: 15",

We will ask whether these strange characters have thoughts and feelings, and whether, if so, they are like us in what they think and feel. The point is not to consider bizarre cases just for the sake of it, but to see what light they can shed on the nature of the mind.

Likewise, in Sigmund Freud\u2019s Thoughts for the Times on War and Death, Freud suggests that there are certain events in human history - certain moments in time - that demand, indeed necessitate, our thinking. The question is: to what extent can we and/or should we understand the task of philosophy as a task of thinking for the times? What is the role of time - of one\u2019s historical situation - in thinking? Is the philosopher capable of responding to the exigency of the times? Or is this role better served by politicians, journalists, poets? How can the philosopher theorize \u2018universal\u2019 structures (being, truth, value) and simultaneously ground his/her thinking in the \u2018particularities\u2019 of a given time? will explore the work of thinkers throughout the history of philosophy who have addressed these important questions. include: Plato, Rousseau, Kant, Marx, Nietzsche, Freud, Heidegger, Benjamin, Arendt, Foucault, Zizek, Butler, West, Ronell.

Painted in this light, the development and use of technology is part of what makes us distinctively human. However, some argue that we have crossed a threshold, where the degree to which we rely upon and incorporate technology in our lives now threatens to obliterate our humanity.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Human Rights Since the 17th century, Western philosophy has been infused with the notion of individual autonomy and its political and legal analogue, consent. In the political sphere this encompasses the social contract and consent of the governed. In the legal sphere it entails the use of state power to fulfill the terms of private agreements. In the ethical sphere it necessitates questions of obligation. Voluntary consent normally serves to authorize one\u2019s participation in mutual exchange. But is one\u2019s consent voluntary if induced by duress or contaminated by circumstances of economic or social inequality? Should unjust agreements be enforceable? What if a just agreement between two parties causes an injustice to a third? Should one be allowed to consent to self- harm? We will examine ethical criteria used to determine when public intervention into private consensual conduct may be justified, and when not. Readings will include selections from Hobbes, Rousseau, Mill, Wertheimer, Nozick, Nussbaum, West, Pateman, codes of sexual conduct and a number of judicial decisions. Class size: 15",

This course will take up the question of what it would mean to become fully conscious of what we do to animals and what they do for us. More specific questions we will discuss include: Should animals have some of the legal rights of humans? Could \"test-tube meat\" provide a viable alternative to slaughtering animals? How are animals represented differently in philosophy and in literature? What should the future of our lives with animals look like? Class size: 15",

In addition to reading a number of Freud\u2019s major works, we will consider philosophical objections and resistances to Freudian psychoanalysis as well as the philosophical legacy thereof.

The course will review the ideas of a few major thinkers such as Adam Smith, Karl Marx, Karl Polanyi, Thorstein Veblen, John Maynard Keynes, and John Kenneth Galbraith, and will introduce students to two subfields in particular: international political economy and the political economy of development. Among the questions we would ask are: Why are some countries rich and others poor? What is development? What are the prime movers of globalization? Is the US an empire given its influence and power in the global economy? How can development be redefined to tackle the challenge of climate change? Among issues that we will look at closely is the role of organizations such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the World Trade Organization in managing the global economy and the current debates about reforming these institutions.

Much of the emphasis is on the evolution of democracy across the region, including examining such questions as why it has taken so long for democracy to take root in Latin America, at least in contrast to the United States and Western Europe, and why does the quality of democracy varies so greatly across the region. Although some democracies are among the most developed in the world, such as Chile, Uruguay and Costa  Rica, the region is also home to some notorious \"illiberal\" democracies, such as Guatemala, and one of the world\u2019s few remaining Communist states, Cuba. The course is organized in three main sections. The first provides a broad historical overview of patterns of political development in Latin  America from the independence period to the present. The second part highlights theoretical approaches to Latin American political development drawn from cultural analysis, Marxism, and state-centric perspectives. The third and final section examines democratic development in five Latin American countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Cuba, and Venezuela). ",

The awareness of the importance of the region and potential for instability animates much of American foreign policy, with the recently released 2015 National Security Strategy focused on the area in part due to the \"security dynamics of the region\" which \"risk escalation and conflict\". What are these \"security dynamics\" that risk instability? This class will identify and address some of the primary security concerns animating the interest in the region and the ongoing calls for an American presence. We will cover the debates surrounding the \"rise of China\" and the implications that has for the US-China relationship, but we will also focus on intra-regional concerns such the proliferation and development of nuclear weapons and the potential remilitarization of Japan. As well, we will identify and explore the nature of some of the major regional maritime disputes (China-Japan, South China Sea), tensions between China and Taiwan, and multilateral security institutions. Finally, we will identify potential areas for security and cooperation within the region as well as with major players internationally. Class size: 22",

But the difficulties with the idealized model of the nation-state are quite apparent for all to see. For instance, various forms of ethno-national mobilization--based on solidarities both larger and smaller than the nation-state\u2014have challenged official state nationalisms. The twenty first century opened with talk of moving beyond the nation-state. But at that time in certain parts of the world multi-national political spaces were getting reorganized along national lines. This was also when failing and collapsed states became top foreign policy concerns of major powers, and a new form of international regimes of intervention came into being. The course will examine the idea of the nation -- its historical and contemporary competitors -- the emergence of the nation-state system, and the challenges confronting this system. Our approach will be comparative and we will draw on the experiences of all world regions.

        "department": "politicalstudies",
        "description": "Cross-listed: Experimental Humanities, Human Rights, Philosophy 2 credits Edward Snowden\u2019s revelations have inaugurated a national discussion about the right of privacy. Over 50% of Americans still support the National Security Administration and among Americans under 30, support for the NSA is over 60%. We share our private lives on social media sites and think little of leaving digital signatures as we shop, read, and drive. We willingly trade privacy for the promise of both increased security and convenience. Privacy is being lost and few seem to care. We are told \"if you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to worry about.\" But who has nothing to hide? What is lost when the dark recesses of the heart are exposed to the light of public censure? Hannah Arendt saw the private realm as the essential refuge for human uniqueness. In daily life, she writes, we \"return back from the outside world and withdraw into the security of private life within four walls.\" These walls of the private \"enclose a secure place, without which no living thing can thrive.\" For Arendt, \"Everything that lives, not vegetative life alone, emerges from darkness and, however strong its natural tendency to thrust itself into the light, it nevertheless needs the security of darkness to grow at all.\" If privacy guards the dark recesses of the human heart, she worried that in a transparent society, we are forced to police private urges and actions by public standards, our belief in public morality appears hypocritical. Distrusting ourselves, we trust no one, which is the source of cynicism of political life. This 2-unit class will meet 6 times. At five meetings prior to the Arendt Center Conference on Oct. 15-16 we will read material on privacy by Hannah Arendt and by authors speaking at the Hannah Arendt Center Conference, including David Brin. Students are required to attend at least two panels or talks at the conference. All students will be required to hand in a final assignment responding to the conference. This may be in the form of a blog post, videos, digital map, or other forms. There will be one post-conference meeting to discuss the conference and students will be able to present their work at the Experimental Humanities Share Event at the end of the semester. ",

Beyond the headlines, however, there are developing trends, emerging actors and competing explanations that are often overlooked. This course examines the international politics in MENA using the theoretical tools of international relations. Major themes include the nature of the state system in the MENA and its creation; the causes of conflict within the region; the roles played by outside powers; and the causes and effects of transnational forces such as Arab nationalism, Islamic radicalism, criminal networks, media and global economic actors. The course will also explore the nature of sub-state and sectarian identities and the effects on regional politics (ie, Sunni vs Shi\u2019i Islam, Kurds, Amazigh. These themes are explored in the context of several case studies, including, but not limited to, the Algerian civil war in the 1990s, the wars in Iraq, the revolution in Libya, and the ongoing crisis in Syria. The course will offer students a better understanding of the international politics of the MENA and will help students appreciate the competing pressures on policymakers as the region changes in rapid and complex ways.  The course will also highlight ways in which international relations theory can be applied to real-world situations. Class size: 22",

        "description": "Cross-listed: Human Rights, Philosophy In 1946, just after the defeat of the Nazis, a French schoolteacher Jean Beaufret wrote a letter to the German philosopher Martin Heidegger. Beaufret asked two questions: First, How are we in the wake of the Holocaust to restore a sense to the word \"humanism\"? And second, How are we to understand the relationship between philosophy and ethics? Heidegger\u2019s response, later published as \"The Letter on Humanism,\" is one of the great efforts to think through the ethical and philosophical significance of the human being. For Heidegger, if we are to preserve the dignity of the human, we must forgo all \u2018isms\u2019 including humanism; we must resist the urge to define a human essence and instead seek the dignity of the human outside of all doctrines and systems. In doing so, Heidegger challenges the foundations of modern humanisms including human rights and liberal social democracy. In this class we will read Heidegger\u2019s \u2018Letter on Humanism\u2019 as well as works by Jean Paul Sartre, Hannah Arendt, and Peter Sloterdijk to ask how, if at all, we can assign dignity to humanity in the 21st century.

While only recently coming to dominate the US national security agenda, terrorism as a political activity has a long history. This seminar will provide a theoretical and empirical examination of terrorism as a political phenomenon. The first part of the course will explore the conceptual and theoretical debates surrounding terrorism. Topics discussed will include the distinctions between terrorism and other forms of political violence, why individuals and groups resort to terrorism to achieve political goals, the role of religion and ideology in motivating terrorist groups, and the importance of state sponsorship in supporting terrorist activity. The second part will address the challenges of counterterrorism, including the strengths and weaknesses of counterterrorist tools such as military force, diplomacy, intelligence and law enforcement, the relationship between counterterrorism and democracy, the role of the international community in stopping terrorism. Throughout the course special effort will be made to situate the US experience with terrorism in a comparative and historical perspective through an examination of prominent case studies drawn from different regions and time periods.

And yet there are also themes and recurring patterns that tie the various periods and cultural settings of Buddhism together. In this course we will begin by examining some of the concepts at the heart of Buddhist psychology and philosophy; this is what Buddhism looks like on paper, so to speak. We will then turn to how Buddhists have practiced and to the institutions they have developed; this is how Buddhism actually looks on the ground. In the final section of the course we will focus more intently on some of the cultural settings in which Buddhism has developed (including the West), asking how Buddhism changed (or did not change) as it grew increasingly distant from its Indian origins. Students should come away from the course with an understanding of a handful of ideas and institutions central to Buddhist thought and practice, a rough idea as to the historical transmission of Buddhist (e.g., it went from India to China), and a sense of why this religion has enjoyed such a positive reputation in the West during the past century-and-a-half.

There are many instances in which Buddhist scriptures, commentaries, and teachings concerning this topic appear to contradict one another. Furthermore, Buddhism has incorporated views from the various cultures in which it has developed, and Buddhist attitudes toward gender in, say, medieval Tibet can be quite different from those found in modern Thailand, for example. In this course we explore these issues as they have appeared and been addressed in a number of Buddhist contexts. After spending our first week focusing on how gender and sexuality have been approached in the modern study of religion, we will turn to early Indian Buddhist attitudes towards gender, then to Buddhist nuns in varying cultural settings, and finally to a number of gender-related themes that have emerged during the course of Buddhism's development. At the end of the course students should be able to identify early Indian Buddhist attitudes towards gender and sexuality, and discuss how these attitudes persisted or changed as Buddhism entered other cultures; discuss the predicament of Buddhist nuns in the modern world; and understand the ways in which Western categories used to understand gender and sexuality are or are not applicable to Buddhism.",

His strategies of non-violent satyagraha were widely and successfully adopted during the Indian independence movement, and they have since been adapted by other political leaders and movements around the world, with varying degrees of success. In this seminar we will examine Gandhi\u2019s life and the development of his philosophy of svaraj and satyagraha. We will consider the colonial South African and Indian conditions in which Gandhi acted, and we will explore the range of Gandhi\u2019s efforts towards personal, political, and social transformation. Finally, students in this seminar will investigate some of the movements that have attempted to apply Gandhian methods in new settings, in India, South Africa, the United States, and elsewhere, and assess their effectiveness. The course will include a series of films that provide different perspectives on the Gandhian legacy, from the hagiographical to the deeply critical. Class size: 15",

        "department": "socstudies",
        "description": "Cross-listed: Human Rights It has now been more than fifty years since the original work of Stanley Milgram at Yale University demonstrated the remarkable and widely unpredicted finding that large numbers of individuals in multiple samples of American men and women studied were willing to \"punish\" another person when ordered to do so by an experimenter; this in the context of a psychology experiment on learning and memory. The prominence of the initial work and the continued salience of such study, including the pronounced ethical considerations and the necessary generalizability to societal and historical contexts cannot be over-stated. As recently as five years ago a replication of the original study with only slight modifications was published (J. Burger, January 2009) and more recent studies reveals that \"obedience\" is very much prevalent in our society and in many others as well. Also the ethical debate and ecological validity controversy have not lessened. But aside from the volume of investigations the current domain of the \"Milgram study\" is especially worthy of continuing interest; this because of historical events in the intervening years since1960. The seminar will convey that the continuing study of obedience phenomena is vital for the betterment of institutions - even in a democratic society - and that social scientists must find a way to safely and ethically investigate the conditions that promote destructive obedience and learn the rudiments of how it can be minimized. This is an upper college seminar. It is designed for moderated social studies majors and even those from other divisions of the college, who will require permission of the instructor to enroll. Criteria for membership are a willingness to read with care and then with conviction share the results of such reading and study. ",

The discipline views the individual in context of the larger society, and sheds light on how social structures constrain and enable our choices and actions. Sociologists study topics as varied as race, gender, class, religion, the birth of capitalism, democracy, education, crime and prisons, the environment, and inequality. At its most basic, the course will teach students how to read social science texts and evaluate their arguments. Conceptually, students will learn basic sociological themes and become familiar with how sociologists ask and answer questions. Most importantly, students will come away from the course with a new understanding of how to think sociologically about the world around them, their position in society, and how their actions both affect and are affected by the social structures in which we all live.

Thus, the study of social and political dynamics in urban centers is crucial if we are to understand and address the pressing issues of the contemporary world. This course will allow students to explore these dynamics through an introduction to urban sociology: the study of social relations, processes, and changes in the urban context. We will begin by reading perspectives on the development of cities, followed by an examination of how the city and its socio-spatial configuration affect and are affected by social interactions, particularly across gender, race, and class lines. The course will then consider the relationship between globalization and the modern city before concluding with a few examples of how citizens address the challenges in their communities. Throughout, we will explore the diverse methods that social scientists use to understand these dynamics, and students will have the opportunity to utilize some of these methods in an investigation of a local \"urban community.\" Class size: 22",

The amount and type of punishment found in society is not a simple, direct result of crime patterns. Rather, to understand how and why we punish, we must examine the ways that historical processes, social structures, institutions, and culture shape penal practices as well as how systems of punishment shape society. This course draws on sociological and historical research to explore the social functions of punishment, its cultural foundations and meanings, what drives changes in how we punish, the relationship between penal practices and state power, and the role of crime control in reproducing race, gender, and class inequality. The class also delves deeply into the theoretical and empirical debates about the punitive turn in American criminal justice over the last 4 decades. We consider the causes and consequences of mass incarceration, the racial disparities in the system, the drug war, changes in policing, the politicization of crime, and the role of criminal justice in the welfare state.

As to the recent past, consider: first black gains since the Civil Rights era (political, economic, social \u2013 however incomplete); second, Hispanics and Asians transforming what it means to be non-white; and third, the virtual disappearance of earlier rigid divisions among Euro-American ethnics such as Irish, Italians, Jews and Slavs. We will explore the meaning of contemporary race, ethnicity and assimilation with these recent American patterns in mind. We will also spend a substantial part of the course on the growing efforts by thoughtful Americans, mostly social scientists, to think about the directions that these patterns of group life may take in the coming few decades. Topics include: social mobility and economic wellbeing, interracial marriage, political power, discrimination, the impact of immigration, group identity and culture, the expected racial transformation to a non-white American majority.

Why does global inequality persist and why does a large share of the world\u2019s population continue to live in abject poverty, despite tremendous efforts made over the last half-century? Through the lens of specific topics, such as unequal impacts of environmental change, informal urban settlements and economies, and growing energy demands, this course examines such questions from two perspectives. First, we look at globalization and other structural forces that create and perpetuate global inequality. Second, we examine the goals and practices promoted by governments, development agencies, non-governmental organizations, and communities. This course will push students to think critically about the meanings and consequences of development, as well as about the challenges and possibilities we face in addressing some of the major social problems of our time.

We will utilize a broad range of historical precedents and contemporary case studies\u2014including controversies over education, the environment, healthcare, police violence, and other topics guided by student interest\u2014to examine how these forms of engagement emerge, if and how they are transforming the meanings of democracy and citizenship, and how evolving understandings of race, class, and gender influence democratic processes.

This was a period of important formal changes in art, from the invention of oil painting to the rise of vernacular art. It was also a time of great upheaval in European society, encompassing the discovery of the new world, the Renaissance, the Reformation, the birth of modern science, and the beginning of the counter-Reformation. We will study the works of Van Eyck, D\u00fcrer, Bosch, and Bruegel, among others, as they expressed the political and quotidian effects of these changes. Our approach will be chronological, but the subjects addressed will reflect the wide range of concerns present in the paintings, prints, tapestries, drawings, and sculpture of major European artists working north of the Alps during this period. Subjects touched on will include patronage, iconoclasm, distribution networks, religion, cross-currents with Italy, gender roles, and the invention and/or revival of local traditions. Course requirements: class attendance, a visit to the Met, two short response papers, mid-term and finals exams. (Art History requirement: 15th through 18th C., Europe) Class size: 22",

Beginning with Leonardo da Vinci, the class analyzes the contributions of Michelangelo, Raphael, Correggio, Pontormo, Parmigianino, Giorgione, Titian, Veronese, and Palladio. In addition to secondary scholarship, readings incorporate primary sources by Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, Palladio, and Vasari.

We will also consider the position of art criticism in relation to film and cultural criticism, as well as models of the poet-critic and the artist-critic. Towards the end of the course we will look at the historical moment in which criticism became increasingly embroiled with theory. As the status of the public has changed in recent years we will ask how the role of criticism has transformed as well. Throughout the course we will ask the question, What can art criticism do? Assignments: Students will be required to submit a weekly response paper.

The second week explores post-antique (up to the present day) reconfiguration of antiquities in order to construct political and theological meaning. The portion of the class in Rome is rigorous, consisting of over seventy hours of lectures at archaeological sites, in museums, and in churches. During the spring semester, the class analyzes the art seen in Rome and discusses the secondary scholarship. Requirements include two presentations (one on texts, one on art), two exams, and a research paper term paper. The prerequisite for the class is successful completion of eitherRoman Art and Architecture (ARTH 210), Roman Urbanism (ARTH 227), or 16th-century Italian Renaissance Art,Architecture, and Urbanism (ArtH 236). The class is limited to sixteen students; priority is based on academic relevance and intellectual maturity. The cost of the Rome component is circa $1700 to include transportation in Rome, lodging, breakfast, museum admissions, and all but two dinners. Airfare is not included, and financial aid does not assist with this fee. Credit will only be awarded upon successful completion of both components of the class. Permission of the professor required.

This course will look at how artistic and curatorial practices can re-engage and bear witness to the veiled vectors of power that shape civic space, reorganize systems of interaction, and challenge existing political, social and economic frameworks, addressing how areas of tension in contemporary society are made visible through these interventions. Through reading, workshops, and discussion, students will explore how alliances between politics and art can be imagined and tested.

In the past several decades it has also been become more stylized for performances on stage and in dance competitions in the Middle East and abroad. This class will offer the opportunity to learn some \"traditional\" versions of dabkeh, danced in a line or a circle, as well as more contemporary choreographies designed for the stage. We will draw especially on forms of dabkeh danced and performed in Palestine today. No prior experience in dance or in dabkeh necessary. Sneakers or flat, hard-soled boots are required.

Course participants develop ways of using video's most fundamental property: its ability to reproduce a stream of real-time synchronized images and sounds. How does video technology mediate between on-screen performer and audience? How can artists interested in creating critical and self-reflexive media respond to video\u2019s immediacy and \"liveness\"? How can performance artists use video playback devices, displays, projectors, and interactive elements to shape and enhance live art? Course participants will work on individual projects using cameras, monitors, switchers, surveillance systems, projectors, and software-based video mixers. The first half of the course concentrates on the creation of performance \"tapes\" (or tape-less video documents) and the history of experimental video focused on framing staged live activities. The second half of the course concentrates on the use of video as a central component within live art events, plus a continued discussion about the larger cultural and psychological impact of live video production.

Great composers both, they came from very different backgrounds--Stockhausen, a German Catholic, Nono an Italian Communist, but both espoused serialism early on, before turning away from it's strict application to expand their horizons in far freer directions. In this respect, the work of John Cage was a major influence. Coming from California and strongly influenced by Asian thought and his own anarchic American ideas of chance and indeterminacy, Cage offered a radically opposing view to the strictures of totally organized serialism. By the end of their lives, Stockhausen had devoted himself to his massive mystical opera\" Licht \" and Nono to very soft and delicate works like his opera Prometeo. All three composers utilized both acoustic and electronic media in their works as well as theatrical and multimedia techniques, breaking new ground in their efforts. Their writings explore new means as well. The works of all three will be analyzed and studied in detail. There will be a midterm and final paper. Class size: 15",

Although catchy, the adage is utterly fallacious. As this course attempts to show, there was never agreement about the phenomenon of \"Rhythm\" in the whole of human history. Musical rhythm, like time, is more accurately considered a relativity -- notions of musical motion, pulse, and meter vary across locations, communities, and individuals. Indeed, musical time changes over the course of time itself. In a History of Rhythm, students will discover various definitions for \"The Beat,\" multiple meanings and practices that dictated \"good rhythm\" within various musical cultures. Weekly lectures focus on historical musical notation, pedagogical techniques, compositional trends, and performance practices. The class will also analyze musical manuscripts and first editions by Machaut, Monteverdi, Vivaldi, Beethoven, Stravinsky, and others. An ability to read music is required. Through the student's successful completion of a final project, this course can fulfill either the music history or theory requirement. Class size: 14",

The projects are sequenced in a way that the students move from a simple dialogue of light and dark and gradually begin to incorporate a fuller range of elements from the vocabulary of painting during the semester. Assignments are designed to promote a recognition that expression in painting is rooted in its form \u2013 color, light, materiality, composition, etc. While much of the work will be done from observation - still life, landscape (weather permitting) and model - there will be assignments that incorporate abstraction as well.

This hybrid approach will be hands-on and will involve 3-dimensional form making, painting and collage.Assignments will be formed around a 20th Century narrative that includes painted constructivist wall sculpture, cubist reliefs, assemblages, specific objects and sculptural props. Ideas explored will include sculpture that depicts pictorial space, the materiality of color and the site as ground for the sculptural figure. Class time will consist of working onprojects, group critiques, presentations, readings anddiscussions of relevantwork as well as demonstrations in materials and techniques.

Fast-paced, highly physical lazzi (comedic \"bits\") are rooted in the class struggles between the servants (the zanni) and their masters (the vecci.) Commedia is cut-throat comedy born of social critique. The archetypes have present-day counterparts, but by living fully in the characters -- their passions, appetites (sexual, financial, culinary), and idiocy -- we find a humanity that transcends its history. This is a demanding physical acting class. Students will be expected to bring a full-throttle physicality, a high level of play and a brave sense of presence/humanity. They will learn mask technique through structured improvisation in class. Presentations of applied principles will be prepared outside of class to be performed/critiqued on a weekly basis.

We will base our discussions on primary and secondary texts and modes of performance from 2,500 years of world theater, starting with Aristotle and the Greek tragic playwrights and approaching the cutting edge of contemporary performance practice. We will ask questions about interpretation, ephemerality, and reenactment, investigate how great artists from across the centuries have controlled our experience of theatrical time and space, and examine such topics as the representation of reality on stage, the relationship between performance and audience, and the constantly evolving interplay of theater and democracy.

Each possesses a distinctly singular voice. Yet as a group they have much in common, including their experimental and radical approaches to writing drama. Each is formally experimental, self-consciously theatrical and playfully inventive. In her own way, each challenges contemporary ideas of feminism and prods audiences to think about how they intersect with such concepts as race, class and capitalism. Still, the work of each is highly individual. As we investigate their similarities and differences we will ask ourselves, what common revelations do they have the potential to illuminate? Among the plays and essays that we will investigate are Parks\u2019 The America Play and Elements of Style, Churchill\u2019s trailblazing play Cloud Nine and the later absurdist plays Blue Kettle/Blue Heart, and The Princess Plays by Jelinek.

We\u2019ll discuss the formal tendencies of the period\u2019s major literary movements (realism, naturalism, regionalism, and modernism) as well as the stylistic departures of each author. At the same time, we will see how their works interact with the range of historical developments that make this period so dynamic\u2014from the socio-legal contexts of Jim Crow and women's voting rights to the invention of new technologies for recording the voice, from the influence of Darwin to that of Marx, and from the end of Reconstruction to the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge.

Have they lasted because they conjure up fantasies of escape, or make its readers and viewers face dilemmas inherent in certain social conditions or archetypical conflicts?

We will look at the majestic, triumphant imaginative liberation in writers such as Isaac Babel, Vladimir Mayakovsky, Osip Mandelstam and Mikhail Bulgakov; the struggle with ideology and the Terror of the 1930s in Yuri Olesha, Anna Akhmatova, Lidia Chukovskaya, Mikhail Zoshchenko, Varlam Shalamov, Boris Pilnyak and Yuri Tynyanov; the hesitant Thaw as reflected in Boris Pasternak\u2019s Dr. Zhivago; and the course will conclude by reading Alexander Solzhenitsyn\u2019s One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich and Moscow to the End of the Line, by Venedikt Erofeev. Readings of literary works will be supplemented with political and historical documents to provide a sense of the larger political-social-historical context in which they were written. After the violent, imaginative ebullience of the Revolutionary period, how did literature stay alive during the darkest period of mass repression, censorship and terror when millions of Soviet citizens were either imprisoned or shot? What formal/aesthetic choices did these writers make in negotiating the demands of official ideology and Party discipline, on the one hand, and authentic literary expression, on the other? What image of history and of man did these \"Engineers of human souls\" produce? These are some of the questions we will ask and seek to answer. All readings will be in English.

        "description": "Cross-listed: American Studies, Human Rights In a 1996 poem titled \"How to Write the Great American Indian Novel,\" Sherman Alexie delivered a series of jabs at the stereotypical Native narrative: \"the hero should often weep alone,\" for instance, while \"A white child and an Indian child, gender / not important, should express deep affection in a childlike way.\" The endgame of such a story is, for Alexie, appropriation and genocide: \"all the white people will be Indians and all the Indians will be ghosts.\" The stereotypes are familiar and Alexie\u2019s satire has bite. Yet of course the field of American Indian fiction is in fact remarkably diverse in its tropes and its narrative forms. We will explore that diversity in texts written in English from the mid-nineteenth century to the early twenty-first. Certain concerns will recur, including population displacement, ecological disaster, the politics of religion, and the relationship between orality and print. We will pay equal attention, though, to each writer\u2019s unique approach to the genre of the novel. In doing so we will consider relationships to tradition, both cultural and literary, that exceed the commonplaces Alexie skewers. Authors will include Black Elk, James Fenimore Cooper, Louise Erdrich, D\u2019Arcy McNickle, N. Scott Momaday, John Oskison, Leslie Marmon Silko, and Yellow Bird. Class size: 22",

In this course you will be encouraged to think about how notions of childhood and teenagerdom are constructed and reproduced in Anglophone literature for young people, and to interrogate the social and literary structures that guide these representations. Our goal will be to gain familiarity with the history of children\u2019s literature in English and some of its major genres, while constantly challenging our own conceptions of childhood and literariness. How can we, as adults and critics, read a book that has been classed as \"children\u2019s literature\"? How do we theorize texts that are written for children by adults? What makes a work of children\u2019s literature a classic? Can we say that children\u2019s literature \"colonizes\" the child? Given their importance to contemporary ideas of the child, we will give special attention to questions of gender and sexuality throughout the semester.

To gain a fuller appreciation of the variety, complexity, and dramatic fascination of Goethe's Faust, we will also consider Faust literature before and after Goethe and explore the integration of Faust in music, theater, and film (e.g., Marlowe\u2019s tragedy Doctor Faustus, Arrigo Boito's opera Mefistofele, Friedrich W.

It often seems as if his most brutally poignant depictions of individuals in hopeless situations arise when he is also his most politically barbed. This course explores how Shakespeare uses the framework of tragedy to investigate the contours of political life, focusing specifically on how familial, friendship, and sexual ties reflect and influence overarching governmental realities. How do we understand kingship after seeing it portrayed as an isolating burden? What do the tragic consequences of notions like honor and duty reveal to us about the interrelations between early modern masculinity and political organization? As we closely analyze several of Shakespeare\u2019s tragedies, including Julius Caesar, Macbeth, Hamlet, Coriolanus, and King Lear, we will also examine writings from the period by figures such as Machiavelli, Bodin, James I, and Thomas Hobbes in order to develop a rich sense of how the problems of government troubling the early modern period were exposed and interrogated upon the stage.This course counts as pre-1800 offering.

In this course, we will explore the myriad ways in which this process and the urban space it has created has been written and represented. We will ask how artists attempt to express and make sense of the shifting field of sensation and information that constitutes city life in modern Japan. We will also examine questions of what is lost in the rural to urban transition and problems of nostalgia and alienation in the countryside and new suburbs. The course explores how the experiences and emotions germane to metropolitan life can be expressed, communicated, and understood through literature, film, photography, music, manga, maps, and more.

In Western history, many of the individuals who have been most admired for their bravery are those who have willingly accepted death for a higher purpose, whether that purpose be intellectual (Socrates), religious (Jewish, Christian, or Muslim martyrs), or political (Thomas Becket, Mahatma Gandhi, Bobby Sands). But what if the cause for which the martyr wishes to sacrifice herself is not a good cause? What if the martyr is driven, not only by a desire for justice, but by a desire for glory or even for death? What if the martyr is willing to sacrifice, not only his life, but the lives of other people around him? What is the relation between martyrdom and fanaticism? In an effort to answer these questions, we will be considering a series of historical moments that produced martyrs, including the persecution of the early Christians, the Battle of Karbala, the Crusades, the Protestant Reformation, the Jesuit missions in Asia and America, the totalitarian regimes of the twentieth century, and September 11th.

With its allegories and polyphonic voices, its multiple narratives, its deliberate silences, literature obscures our access to pat answers about good and evil, vice and virtue. Reading a historical account of courage or cowardice is radically different from its being conveyed in a poem, a play, or a novel. This class will examine how writers have disguised and distorted a quality such as courage to convey the multi-faceted nature of human motives and motivation. Each of our examples of courage will be read in clashing ways. Is Antigone's heroism a mark of hubris? Shakespeare's Cordelia's refusal to lie\nstubborness? Don Quixote's idealism insanity? Melville's Bartleby's standing up to authority obstructionism? Are Camus' The Plague and Saramago's Blindness allegories of courage or narratives of the absurd?

It is Freud who taught us to read slips of the tongue, bungled actions, memory lapses, dreams, and symptoms\u2014what he calls formations of the unconscious\u2014as speech in their own right. He explored how speech implicates us at a level far beyond what we typically consider communication, how it structures us as subjects. While Freud\u2019s influence spans art, literature, and the human sciences, his ideas continue to engender wide-ranging debates about the efficacy of the psychoanalytical cure and its scientific status. Even those critical of Freud\u2019s method, however, cannot deny that his concepts (such as the unconscious, repression, transference, or sexual and death drives) have become part of our everyday language, thus bearing witness to the extent in which they are ingrained in the way we perceive ourselves, society, and the world. This course will address fundamental concepts of Freudian psychoanalysis, a field that encompasses both a body of theoretical knowledge and a clinical practice grounded in listening and interpretation. Readings will include selections from Freud\u2019s seminal texts, as well as writings by Jacques Lacan and other authors, whose work provides insight into Freud\u2019s ideas and their intersection with literature, film, and poetry, such as St\u00e9phaneMallarm\u00e9, Marguerite Duras, and W. G. Sebald. Class size: 18",

Yet, Chaucer never finished The Canterbury Tales: he spent the last dozen years of his life working on the Tales, dying in 1400 and leaving behind a fragmented collection of stories that readers have been reassembling since his death. In this course we will undertake a semester-long exploration of The Canterbury Tales, reading the text and piecing together the picture of medieval England that it at once preserves and critiques. We will be particularly concerned with the literary and cultural conventions that Chaucer both expertly mobilizes and fascinatingly troubles. (This course counts as pre-1800 offering.)

Prior to this technological innovation (which the sixteenth-century writer John Foxe deemed miraculous), books were made from vellum (animal skin) and were written and illuminated\u2014or painted\u2014by hand. In this course, we\u2019ll study Anglo-Saxon and medieval English books as both cultural objects and literary artifacts, dividing our time between learning how manuscript-books were imagined and constructed before the invention of the printing press, and reading them. For us, \"reading\" will mean engaging in literary analysis of our texts\u2014including epics, lyrics, myths, and romances, all of which will be made available in modern printed editions\u2014as well as learning to decipher the handwriting of scribes responsible for copying our texts. Our work will raise questions about literacy and its definitions; literary labor; the history of the book; the development and preservation of literary and visual artifacts; the relationship between image and text; the ethical and practical problems of producing modern printed editions of handwritten texts; and the proximity of anonymous pre-print culture to the so-called Internet Age.

The books we read, the tastes we acquire, and the ambitions we hold make us into insiders or outcasts, depending on where we stand. Do social structures inevitably reproduce themselves or can we ever hope to start over? Using literary and philosophical texts, this class will explore the tenuous process of passing from one condition to another. Whether this integrative process involves race, country, sexuality, gender, or socio-economics, it explodes the notion of a stable and unchanging self and focuses on border zones of culture and being. We will explore the threatening and liberating resonances of hybrid states and deterritorialized sensibility. Double-consciousness (W.E.B. Du Bois), double temporality (Spinoza), and double diaspora are some terms that will help us study the pain and loss involved in the plasticity of self, in the broken and rebuilt habits at the heart of our desire to be accepted.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Medieval Studies Throughout its history, romance has been criticized for the effects it has upon its readers. Dante Alighieri\u2019s Francesca ends up in Hell for eternity because she has read the romance of Lancelot, Miguel de Cervantes\u2019 Don Quixote tilts after windmills because he has been reading romances, and Gustave Flaubert\u2019s Emma Bovary veers into adulterous affairs because she has indulged in similar reading matter. The alternate world presented by romance\u2014with its knights errant, beautiful princesses, fantastic animals, enchanted forests, and decentralized geography\u2014can seem more attractive than our own mundane world and, in doing so, can threaten to distract us from this world and our responsibilities within it. Over the semester, we will be reading the major works of romance literature and, in doing so, will be considering the uncertain moral status of this genre. What function does romance play in our imaginative life? What is \"escapism,\" and is it necessarily undesirable? Is the danger of romance ultimately the danger of literature or even of the imagination itself? Texts to be read include classical romances; medieval Arthurian romances; Renaissance romance epics; and modern novels that emerge out of the romance tradition.

We begin in the early nineteenth century, when popular Enlightenment ideology suggested Americans could control their own destinies, making and remaking their characters, and even their bodies, at will. What ideas emerged here about the kind of self one should make, and the kinds of bodies that should be discarded? How were those ideas proffered in and shaped by literary imaginings? How have they persisted and changed over time, especially in relation to ideas about American identity? Our reading list takes us into the present day, and includes an introduction to the major questions and scholarly perspectives under debate in the emerging field of Disability Studies. Possible readings include short fiction by Poe, Hawthorne, Steinbeck, O\u2019Connor, and Morrison; novels by Howe (The Hermaphrodite), Phelps (The Silent Partner), Davis (Life in the Iron Mills), and Haddon (The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time); memoirs by Keller, Mairs, Fries, and Kuusisto; drama by Nussbaum (Mishuganismo); and poetry by Whitman and Barnes, and from the groundbreaking recent anthology, Beauty is a Verb.

We will be studying reportage as well as criticism, looking at examples of both genres since Macaulay\u2019s contributions to the Edinburgh Review. The question is what lifts journalism to a higher literary level. We will consider some famous examples: John Hersey on Hiroshima, Michael Herr\u2019s dispatches on the Vietnam War, Alma Guillermoprieto on Latin American politics, Hunter S. Thompson on the party conventions, V.S. Naipaul on Trinidad. Other questions dealt with in this course include the vexed one of literary license. Reportage by Ryszard Kapuscinski and Curzio Malaparte is fine literature, to be sure. Both claimed to be writing journalism. But they clearly made things up. Can a writer have it both ways: the license of fiction, and the claim to be presenting the truth? Finally, we will read some of the best critics, including Cyril Connolly, Edmund Wilson, and Pauline Kael. Class size: 18",

To this end we will read works by Emerson, Thoreau, and Muir, and then move forward to contemporary writers such as Annie Dillard, Gretel Ehrlich, and Edward Abbey. There will be weekly writings on the readings and an occasional quiz. In addition, students will keep a nature journal and produce one longer creative essay that results from both experience and research, and one longer creative paper. This means that students must be willing to venture into the outdoors\u2014woods, river or mountains. Prior workshop experience is not necessary. A curiosity about the natural world is essential.

How does one, when given 5000 words of real estate in TheNew York Review of Books, or the New Yorker, or Harper's, write an essay which will engage the new work of literary merit -- a collection of poetry or stories; a novel; a biography of a writer of any of these forms -- and offer an opinion of the work's merits that is as fair to the ambitions of the author in question as it is to the larger endeavor of literary enterprise? How, in short, do you say what you think while the clock ticks and a reputation awaits being made or unmade? And how do you do that in a literary culture where less and less space is given over to this essential humanistic endeavor: the public conversation about books? In this workshop, we will read examples of literary criticism from throughout its history including writing by Samuel Johnson, William Hazlitt, Thomas De Quincy, Virginia Wolff, Edmund Wilson, Mary McCarthy, John Updike, Denis Donoghue, David Foster Wallace, John Jeremiah Sullivan, Rivka Galchen, and James Wood. Through this exposure to the varieties of argumentative experience, we will learn how such pieces are structured and how arguments -- aesthetic ones -- are mounted and defended, to the end of writing a final, 3500-word piece of long-form literary criticism of our own.

Instead, he argues, the representation of death allows us tolearnabout the state that inevitably awaits us all. Aristotle touches here on the ultimate point of human experience (death), by limiting its intellectual contemplation to the realm of representation, of art. This very gesture traces the path to rebirth: what is dead lives again (albeit differently) in its representation. This seminar will explore how exactly literature deals with and challenges the task that Aristotle assigns it. From advice on how best to prepare for death to the argument against the death penalty; from ritual sacrifice to suicide; from the resurrection of the dead to the euthanasia of the living; this course will address many of the ways in which literature veritably defies death. Readings from (but not limited to) Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes, Montaigne, Racine, Rousseau, Hugo, Nerval, Baudelaire, Sartre, Camus, Bataille, Blanchot and Quignard. Taught in French.

Although students will be asked to read extensively within the obra of each of these writers, class time will be mainly spent in close analysis of selected texts.

In this regard, we will attempt to answer these and other questions: What occasioned the shift, in Neruda and Vallejo, from a vanguardist, hermetic poetry to a more accessible and socially-oriented poetry? How are Eastern religious and philosophical orientations, particularly those of Buddhism, manifested in the work of Paz? In what ways does the poetry of Guill\u00e9n respond to racial and socio-political issues crucial to an understanding of Cuba's history? How can we apply contemporary discourses concerning gender and the representation of the body to the poetry of Pizarnik?

This class will challenge students to critically engage with the rhetorical function of information visualization. This criticism (i.e. reading) will be complemented and reinforced by creating new visualizations (i.e. writing), a process that is part science, part design and part art. In this short course, students will use a variety of computational platforms including pencil and paper, spreadsheets, software visualization toolkits, and their own small programs to bring datasets to graphical life. The pitfalls and advantages of various methods of presenting numeric, geographic and textual datasets will be constructed and deconstructed. No prerequisites.

Yet, we experience reading as a continuous flow of information. Reading reflects a fundamental question for the study of sensation and perception: how does our brain construct a stable representation of the world when provided with ever changing sensory information? This course will begin to address this, and related questions, by studying the anatomy and physiology of sensory structures that receive stimulus information, with a particular emphasis on the visual and auditory systems. Next, we will move to the cognitive processes that turn this raw sensory information into our perception of the world. Finally, we will discuss how the same sensory information can often lead to very different perceptions across individuals and cultures. Readings will consist of a combination of textbook chapters and empirical articles. Prerequisite: PSY 141, CMSC 131 or permission of instructor. Class size: 22",

How do public policies affect decisions to save for retirement, seek preventive medical care, or conserve environmental resources? John F. Kennedy captured a truth about human decision-making when he noted that \"[t]he essence of ultimate decision remains impenetrable to the observer - often, indeed to the decider himself.\" In this course, we will heed Kennedy's reminder that conscious reflection and verbal report often lead to inaccurate descriptions of the causes of our judgments and decisions. Our focus will be on trying to ascertain the underlying causes of these mental processes by relying on contemporary research in fields such as psychology, neuroscience, economics, political science that offer the systematic study of how people make decisions given limited time and vast uncertainty. Sources will include empirical articles as well as review papers, videos, and case studies. We will consider applications of this work to domains such as finance, politics, the environment, and medicine.

Why do we more easily recognize and register the bad and why is it more salient in our lives than the good? The so-called negative bias that \"bad is stronger than good\" has been found across a wide array of psychological literature in both human and animal life. This demonstrated from Asch (1946) within his work on impression formation and in more recent literature surveys [Baumeister (2001); Rozin and Royzman (2001)] This bias moreover is consistent over a myriad of topics such as: social relations; emotions; mood; learning and even information processing; physiological arousal; and memory. In this seminar we examine studies across the domain of psychology and other disciplines to show that the phenomena is sufficiently ubiquitous so as to reflect and perhaps even explain the events sensed and perceived in our life space. Observe how the bad dominates the daily report in the media. What does this phenomenon mean with respect to the presence or absence of optimism and associated behavior, or for the conduct of child rearing or the power of the variable of happiness and other positive life circumstances? Moreover, an effort to find non-confirming data produces a negative result. No matter the variable studied bad exists at the center of our focus while good is relegated to the periphery. This is an upper college seminar for students of many disciplines. Class size: 10",

Ritual contexts to be explored will include beauty contests, Carnival, and soccer, and Catholic, Protestant evangelical and Afro-Brazilian religious practices.

In the 1980s and 90s, as Japanese economic power and cultural influence grew worldwide, the nation's status as a global force was established beyond question. In more recent years, however, specters of economic recession, disenchanted youth, aging population, and nuclear disaster have produced new conditions of precarity, reconfiguring experiences and meanings of contemporary life. By focusing on such key transitions over the past seven decades, this course will offer an introduction to changing social, economic, and political formations in Japan from an anthropological perspective. Readings will include ethnographic works on economic recovery in the post-war period, gender in office politics, schools and disciplinary tactics, cultures of cuteness, delayed marriage and divorce, homelessness, and care for the elderly. The final section of the course will explore transnational dimensions of Japan in a global context, including the aspirations of Japanese youth in the U.S., and the globalization of popular culture genres such as anime and manga.

Our geographical scope will extend beyond Israel/Palestine to include Palestinian refugees and the diaspora. Our goal will be double: One, to gain a better grasp of this place, its people and its problems. And two, to learn something about concepts whose meanings are either taken for granted in this context and concepts often thought to be irrelevant to modern Palestine, which is dismissed as an exceptional place. Questions will include: What is resistance? What are the politics of martyrdom? When is violence normalized? Are human rights dead? What is the relationship between journalism and statehood? Can architecture wield power? Is there a Palestinian state? What\u2014and where\u2014is Israeli sovereignty? What is the relationship between gender and memory? How does bureaucratic authority work? What are the politics of humanitarian aid? Class size: 22",

In the wake of such intense turmoil, nations struggled to reinvent themselves at the moment of Independence, scripting new national mythologies and appeals for unity. This course explores these contests over nationhood in the post-apartheid era, focusing primarily on the experiences of Zimbabwe and South Africa. Some of the main themes we will address include the politics of commemoration and the symbolic capital of liberation war veterans, the charismatic authority of individuals such as Nelson Mandela and Robert Mugabe, sexual violence and the trial of Jacob Zuma, the role of sport in reimagining national identity, and the paradox of white African belonging. We will examine memories of ethnic genocide in Matabeleland documented by the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace, and track new anxieties in the media precipitated by the influx of immigrants into South Africa. In the final section of the course, we will turn to recent alliances between Africa and China, and possibilities for the emergence of an alternate global order. Class size: 22",

The techniques and technologies of public memory we will examine may include ancient \"memory palaces,\" historical writing, oral narrative, ritual, myth, monuments, museums and archives. We will also explore how radio and photography are used to produce national and familial representations of the past. The focus in each section will be on how the particular medium of remembering shapes the content of what is remembered. We will address who has access to memory practices, stressing the link between the production of particular memories and their political uses. The class will give students a theoretical base to write a final research paper that situates a contemporary memory practice in its specific cultural and historical context: the recent proliferation of family genealogies, Holocaust testimonies and/or museums, the truth commissions, local histories are among a few possible examples.",

The past century in particular has witnessed a radical reconceptualization in the nature of human-animal relations, emerging in tandem with the modern environmentalist movement. Everywhere we turn, animals have captured the popular imagination, with dinosaurs crowned as the cultural icon of the 1990s, Shamu representing the fulfillment of our romantic vision of cetaceans, and Winnie the Pooh constituting a social universe in which children are taught morality and kindness. Beneath the centrality of animals in our social, economic, and physical worlds, moreover, lies their deep implication within human cultural politics. Some of the questions we will consider throughout the semester include: how, and by whom, is the line between humans and animal drawn? What are the politics of taxonomy and classification? How do animal subjectivities contribute to the formation of human identities? Where are animals positioned on the moral landscapes of cultures? We will explore these shifting terrains through the angle of \u2018animal geography,\u2019 a field that focuses on how animals have been socially defined, labeled, and ordered in cultural worldviews.

        "description": "In the fall of 2008 financial systems worldwide became engulfed in a financial crisis of extraordinary proportions. Despite the intervention of global authorities, trillions of dollars in financial wealth disappeared, almost overnight. In the half a decade since, most developed countries have experienced lackluster economic growth, which have also impacted social conditions. All this has happened before and, most certainly, will happen again. The purpose of this course is to provide students with an introduction to some of the causes and effects of historical episodes of financial crisis. We will find that while certain similarities do exist, no two financial crises are exactly the same; that is, generating from the same causes, or creating the same economic effects, or being resolved in the same manner. Reviewing approximately four centuries of financial crisis through the examination of historical sources written by individuals living through the crises themselves, as well as subsequent scholarly and popular studies, we will develop a historically-based understanding of the impact of financial crisis upon social and economic conditions. In the course of our historical investigation into the causes and effects of financial crisis, we will attempt to answer such key questions as: Are financial crises themselves unavoidable? And, if not, what are the policy options available to authorities in the mitigation and resolution of financial crises. Class size: 22",

This course will survey the diverse traditions in economics and introduce students to competing paradigms. It covers several distinct approaches including Classical Political Economy, Neoclassical, Institutionalist, Post Keynesian, Marxist, Feminist, Development and Green Economics. The objective is to gain a broad appreciation of the specific problems that each of these traditions emphasizes and the contributions to theory and policy each has made. Students will examine not only the evolution of ideas and theories, but also their practical application today. Some of the specific issues that the course will consider include the causes and cures for unemployment, the evolution and interaction of culture, technology and the environment, and the role and nature of money in shaping the modern world.

Public sector economics (or public economics) covers four general areas: Government revenue, government spending, regulation, and public choice (study of incentives influencing the behavior of voters, politicians, and bureaucrats, and of the consequences of alternative decision structures). This course focuses on the microeconomics of the public sector. Specific topics covered include market failures, externalities, public goods, optimal taxation, the economic theory of voting, regulatory capture, and fiscal federalism. As the field is broad, we focus on applications to the US economy. Prerequisite: Econ 100. Class size: 22",

The second is to use the different theoretical lenses for analyzing key policy concerns such as pay differentials, discrimination, comparable worth policies, unpaid care burden, labor force participation, poverty and other.

The first literature asks \"big\" questions on why some economies are less developed than others, focusing on long-term historical, ecological and political determinants. Relying on innovative policy experiments, the second literature attempts to answer \"small\" questions on whether a specific policy intervention (e.g. micro loans) can help improve a specific development outcome (e.g. small business growth). Students are expected to write an original research paper that draws on both traditions to address a specific development problem or policy. Prerequisites: Econ 229 and Econ 201, 202 or 221. ",

Its research agenda reaches broadly into diverse aspects of economic and social theory. As a practical philosophy, geoclassical thought has roots in ancient Arabic and Hebrew traditions. As an analytical system, it emerged during the 17th through the 19th centuries in the political economy of John Locke, Fran\u00e7ois Quesnay, Adam Smith, David Ricardo, John Stuart Mill, and Henry George. We review the classic and contemporary literature of geoclassical economics and explore its relationship to other schools of economic thought\u2014neoclassical, ecological, and institutional. We also examine applications to both contemporary and enduring social problems, including: the Great Recession of 2008; rising inequality; crushing private and public debt burdens; distortionary taxes and subsidies; ecological destruction, urban blight, and suburban sprawl; and territorial disputes.

This course will examine the history of the German-speaking lands from Napoleon's dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806 through the development of the German state in 1871, the cataclysmic initiation by this state of the two twentieth-century World Wars, and the creation of the new political entity of the European Union. Attention will placed throughout on the dialog of Germany and Europe in relation to regional structural issues, particularly state form and Realpolitik, capitalism and communism, the 'second-industrial revolution' and institutional development, and state control or surveillance and systems of rights. Using an array of primary documents, we will examine Germany's pivotal place in the ideological divisions, political catastrophes, and -- more optimistically -- theoretical, political, and scientific innovations of modern Europe. As a guiding theme, we will use the paradox that even as Germany is chronologically perhaps the most 'modern' of European states, its definition - and with it the identity of its citizens - has been haunted since inception by its heterogeneous past. Topics of particular importance will include: the multiple 'unifications' of Germany (as a culture, a state, a racist 'greater' Germany, a reunified power within the European Union), the role of 'German' and 'European' identity in colonial expansion and Nazi propaganda, 'scientific' racism and the Holocaust, the development of the DDR and BRD, the consolidation of the European Union since 1951, and the student protests of 1968.

In this course, we will look at several different epochs' definition of experiment, focusing on the classical, medieval, and finally renaissance era to the present. Throughout, we will understand the concept of experiment as closely connected with an era's broader cosmology and definition of experience, and as such will see the epistemological problem of the experiment in a framework that includes aesthetics, theology, ethics and politics. We will also assume that \"experiment\" has taken different forms in the different sciences, and even in fields such as art and law.

The non-white racial groups we speak oftodayare part of this history: blacks, Asians and native Americans. But so too are the many European immigrant groups who arrived in their tens of millions by the 1920s: Italians, Slavs, Jews; and so too are Mexicans, Chinese and others. The course has two goals.First, it traces the social history of these peoples across the years of mass immigration, Depression, two world wars and the Civil Rights era (1950s and 1960s). Second, it also traces the ways in which these peoples were in fact understood -- especially by intellectuals and in government classifications like the Census. For example, immigration authorities regularly classified the European peoples mentioned above as races, and many Americans thought some of these races much more suited for America than others. So too did most of the Congressmen who voted to end unrestricted immigration in the twenties. Or to cite another example, the 1930 U.S. Census enumerated 'Mexicans' as a distinct race. And finally, federal concern with discrimination against American \"minorities\" developed from the forties to the sixties changing who was included among the minorities. In taking up such topics, we will also confront how and how much 'whiteness' was changing. Class size: 22",

        "description": "Cross-listed: Africana Studies, Asian Studies, Environmental & Urban Studies, Human Rights The Indian Ocean travels along Africa\u2019s Swahili Coast, and for some time has facilitated the movement of people, goods, and ideas between Africa and Asia. In addition to being an oceanic divide, the Indian Ocean is a historiographical tradition through which to think about Africa\u2019s historical past in ways not permitted by the Black Atlantic tradition. This course seeks to engage the Indian Ocean as both an object of study and a theoretical lens onto Africa\u2019s history. In turn, it will consider the ways that populations in Africa and Asia even before European colonization engaged with the Ocean in their daily lives as well as how such activities like fishing, sailing and farming reshaped geographies of colonization and resistance in East and Central Africa. Students will use architectural plans and traveler accounts to reconstruct the historical origins of slave and trading towns on the Swahili Coast. Participants will also consider how this early history set the backdrop against which not only nationalist movements fought for Southern Africa\u2019s independence but the Cold War played out in Africa. This colonial and nationalist context offers an analytical space to revisit more recent engagements with the Indian Ocean, particularly China\u2019s and Brazil\u2019s renewed interest with the region, the mineral wars of the Great Lakes, and the identity politics at play around displaced migrant communities. This course seeks to use the history of the Indian Ocean as it relates to Africa in order to prompt a rethinking of the geographical and theoretical axes along which we engage with African histories of colonialism, nationalism, and decolonization.

It is an intellectual history exploring African diasporic political and social movements from revolutionary and anti-colonial resistance to pan-Africanism and n\u00e9gritude. Theorizations of diaspora and exilic identities emerge in tension with the contemporary understanding of national identity, where birthplace, homeland, natal language, and loss became rival terms in the struggle for territorial- and self-sovereignty. By focusing on the francophone world, students will follow developments in Paris, Marseilles, Saint Domingue/Haiti, Martinique, Guadeloupe, and Senegal enabling them to assess heterogeneous responses to a single imperial framework. We read across genres --history by C.L.R. James, poetry of Aime C\u00e9saire, essays of L\u00e9opold Senghor and Suzanne C\u00e9saire, psycho-social theory of Frantz Fanon, and a novel by Maryse Cond\u00e9.

En route to find the \"Lost City of Gold,\" Spanish soldiers sack Acoma Pueblo and then flee. \"Coromantees\" and Irish servants challenge English slaveholders' dominion in Barbados and nearly succeed. Colonial America existed in a constant state of war. This course is a close study of formal and informal military conflicts from the 16th to the early 19th centuries, looking at well-known engagements such as the so-called \"French and Indian War\" and lesser known episodes, like the French and Abenaki raid on Deerfield in 1704. Students will learn how European and indigenous American rules of violence developed, shifted, and adapted in response to the Columbian Exchange, and how war came to shape contemporary American identity. In addition to primary sources, we will consider literary, cinematic, and live reenactment interpretations of colonial conflicts and consider what these tell us about the relationships of history and memory.

Rather than studying the history of the colonized non-West in relation to Europe, this course brings to the forefront the connections between different parts of the colonized world, most notably the Middle East and South Asia. It does so through studying economic and intellectual developments. The two centuries under consideration witnessed major reorientations of the trade networks that tied together the Mediterranean and Indian Ocean economies, as well as the making (and re-making) of economic enterprises of global significance such as the East India Company in the 1700s, the Suez Canal in the 1800s and the discovery of oil in the 1900s. Along the same trade routes, and in response to the radically changing economies of the colonized world, emerged a plethora of ideas (and ideologies) such as nationalism, Islamism, anti-capitalism and, in the twentieth century, Third-Worldism.

An ancient tradition claims that we have a detailed set of inborn capabilities and limitations, rich in implications for how we can live our lives and organize society. An opposing tradition emphasizes plasticity and indeterminacy; at the limit, it pictures us as \"blank slates,\" ready to form ourselves or to be formed by society. What remains of this debate once we refine the claims of each side? If there is a human nature, what is it, who can speak with authority about it, and what implications does it have for changing what we are? If there isn\u2019t a human nature, does this more freely license the genetic and technological development of what we are? We will investigate these and other questions in the course through an interdisciplinary mix of readings from philosophy, psychology, evolutionary biology, and other fields. Class size: 22",

Within this utterance one can hear the perpetual human quest for knowledge, understanding, and truth, for reason, ground, and cause, for warrant and explanation. To ask \"why\" of the world is to refuse to take the world as a given. Indeed, to ask \"why\" of the world is to begin to engage in the act of philosophical thinking\u2014to demand analysis, reflection, and thought. The history of philosophy can be read as orbiting around a series of important \"why\" questions: Why being and not non-being? Why good and not evil? Why suffering? Why death? Why know? Why question? Why write? Why philosophize? This course will attempt to explore these questions and the ways in which they have been articulated and answered throughout the history of Philosophy. Philosophers to be addressed include: Plato, Descartes, Rousseau, Kant, Marx, Nietzsche, Freud, Heidegger, Arendt, Camus, and Sartre. Class size: 22",

        "description": "Cross-listed: Mind, Brain & Behavior The philosophy of mind addresses questions regarding the nature of the mind-brain relation, mental representation, and conscious awareness, to name a few. The dominant trend in contemporary philosophy of mind is to pursue these questions in close alliance with empirical sciences, such as psychology, cognitive science, and neuroscience. The result is typically a mechanistic and reductive picture of the mind, one on which the mind is just one arena among many in which causal factors operate to produce effects. However, some philosophers question whether a mechanistic picture of the mind can adequately accommodate our first person perspective, that is, what it feels like from the inside to have a mind and navigate the world with it. In this course, we will address the question of whether mechanistic accounts of the mind can accommodate our first person perspective by focusing on three main topics: the qualitative or phenomenological dimension of experience; our knowledge of our own attitudes; and our engagement in mental action.

This course is not just for those who care about the life of the medieval mind: it is also for anyone who wants to know what happened to ancient philosophy, or who is curious about where modern philosophy came from. And don't believe the hype: medieval philosophers are not a bunch of ivory-tower scholastics arguing about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin. In fact, medieval philosophers engaged deeply with many of the most difficult and vital philosophical questions: Do we have free will? Where does evil come from? What are the limits of human reason? Can the universe be fully explained, or does it contain an element of the irrational and mysterious? This course will introduce students to the rich variety of approaches medieval philosophers developed in thinking about these and other fundamental philosophical problems. We will especially focus on the insights and challenges medieval philosophers uncovered in their attempts to combine the pagan traditions of ancient philosophy with the prophetic revelations of Christianity and Islam.

The course will review the ideas of a few major thinkers such as Adam Smith, Karl Marx, Karl Polanyi, Thorstein Veblen, John Maynard Keynes, and John Kenneth Galbraith, and will introduce students to two subfields in particular: international political economy and the political economy of development. Among the questions we would ask are: Why are some countries rich and others poor? What is development? What are the prime movers of globalization? Is the US an empire given its influence and power in the global economy? How can development be redefined to tackle the challenge of climate change? Among issues that we will look at closely is the role of organizations such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the World Trade Organization in managing the global economy and the current debates about reforming these institutions.

Although some democracies are among the most developed in the world, such as Chile, Uruguay and Costa Rica, the region is also home to some notorious \"illiberal\" democracies, such as Guatemala, and one of the world\u2019s few remaining Communist states, Cuba. The course is organized in three main sections. The first provides a broad historical overview of patterns of political development in Latin America from the independence period to the present. The second part highlights theoretical approaches to Latin American political development drawn from cultural analysis, Marxism, and state-centric perspectives. The third and final section examines democratic development in five Latin American countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Cuba, and Venezuela). Class size: 20",

The five Central Asian countries, caught in the middle of such neighbors as Russia, China, Afghanistan and Iran, present a mix of many problems of comparative politics. Anchored on the theme of state-building, this course takes up a range of issues salient for the region: the Soviet legacy, informal politics, authoritarianism, corruption, identity politics, and geopolitics. The course also specifically posits the question of the possibility of democracy and the challenge of democratization in a difficult geopolitical context. Through this probing survey of these countries, the course proposes some answers as to why building good states should be difficult. Class size: 18",

What makes some people dare to speak truth to power and resist injustice while others cooperate in oppression or evil? Political courage comes not from a superhuman morality but flows from internal strength. Only those who know themselves and love themselves can risk themselves, secure in the belief that what they do is right and just. Courageous actors are self-thinkers who have the courage to be who they are even when \u2018who they are\u2019 is dangerous for the status quo. But how are we to understand and nurture the genesis of spiritual and moral courage in the face of a world increasingly beset by impersonal and bureaucratic systems of evil? Where can we find the courage to be advocates for good in world where all the incentives lead us to turn quietly away? Readings combine theoretical accounts from Hannah Arendt, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Plato, Stanley Milgram, and Paul Tillich with examples of political courage including Antigone, Abraham Lincoln, John F. Kennedy, Ralph Ellison, Mahatma Gandhi, Daniel Ellsberg, Edward Snowden, and suicide bombers. This course is part of the College Seminar \"The Practice of Courage.\" It is open to Sophomores and Juniors and is limited to 16 students.

Globalization and the emergence of a new international division oflabor, has reframed the debates.

What are the foundational values and principles of anarchism(s)? What distinct anarchist movements existed globally and how did they differ from each other? How do anarchist movements define their relationship to violence? Can we talk about a \"come-back\" of anarchism today? We will cover a broad range of theorists including Bakunin, Kropotkin, Hakim Bey, Alexander Berkman, and Emma Goldman, and address particular historical practices of anarchism including the experience of the French Commune, anarchism during the Russian Revolution, the Spanish Civil War, American anarchism, and Anarchists Against the Wall.

This timeless question serves as an entry point for this comparative politics seminar on \"democratization,\" a field of study that examines what social and political factors grease the transition to democracy and facilitate its consolidation; why does the consolidation of democratic institutions and practices proceeds faster in some countries than in others; and how do new democracies settle the legacies of human rights abuses left behind by the old regime, and what are the consequences of whatever decisions are made about those abuses for the emerging democratic regime? These questions are examined in this seminar through an expansive analysis of the theoretical literature on democratization and a wealth of empirical materials drawn from a wide range of countries that have embarked upon a transition to democracy since World War II. The first half of the course examines the concepts and issues in the study of democratization, like the meaning of democracy and the factors aiding in the rise and consolidation of democratic governance--from culture, to the economy, to the behavior of the elite and ordinary citizens. The second explores the politics of democratization in five cases: Germany after the Nazi regime; Spain after the Franco dictatorship; Argentina after military rule; Russia after Communism, and Egypt after the Mubarak regime.

While only recently coming to dominate the US national security agenda, terrorism as a political activity has a long history. This seminar will provide a theoretical and empirical examination of terrorism as a political phenomenon. The first part of the course will explore the conceptual and theoretical debates surrounding terrorism. Topics discussed will include the distinctions between terrorism and other forms of political violence, why individuals and groups resort to terrorism to achieve political goals, the role of religion and ideology in motivating terrorist groups, and the importance of state sponsorship in supporting terrorist activity. The second part will address the challenges of counterterrorism, including the strengths and weaknesses of counterterrorist tools such as military force, diplomacy, intelligence and law enforcement, the relationship between counterterrorism and democracy, the role of the international community in stopping terrorism. Throughout the course special effort will be made to situate the US experience with terrorism in a comparative and historical perspective through an examination of prominent case studies drawn from different regions and time periods.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Theology (Working Theologies course) Recent advances in the critical study of theology have developed paradigms of how religious systems function. For the purpose of the comparative study of religion, religious systems are approached along the lines of ritual, meaning, and ethics. In this course, each of these terms is explained further. But we can say provisionally that \"ritual\" refers to the agreed activities that people in society learn in order to relate commonly to one another and to the central values they share. \"Meaning\" involves how those values are articulated into a coherent view of the purpose of life in society, and often beyond society. (Typically, meaning involves a conception of the divine, but there are religious systems that resist postulation of God.) Finally, ethics is the actionable face of a religious system, where a person\u2019s engagement with daily life articulates religion in immediate terms. By approaching the basics of Christianity as a religious system that evolves through history, both their context and their significance will make it plain what makes them indispensable. At the same time, a theoretical approach that assesses Christianity as scholars of religion might approach any system means the analysis benefits, not only practitioners, but all those who wish to understand how the world\u2019s largest religion has grown, evolved, and shaped the sensibilities of its adherents.

It defines some sexual acts between two men as an \"abomination\" for which capital punishment is prescribed. What are the origins of these practices, and the social, theological, and psychological attitudes that they reflect?

How are the controversial verses often associated with the Qur\u2019an interpreted? How do modern understandings of \"scripture,\" \"sacrality,\" \"text,\" and \"meaning\" determine, dominate, and perhaps limit the way we engage with premodern sacred material? Class size: 22",

        "description": "Cross-listed: Psychology A year or so ago a photography/psychology student discovered, or at least conjectured although not yet proven, that photographically conveying a sad or negative scene to a viewer was somehow easier then doing so for a cheerful landscape. Why do we more easily recognize and register the bad and why is it more salient in our lives than the good? The so-called negative bias that \"bad is stronger than good\" has been found across a wide array of psychological literature in both human and animal life. This demonstrated from Asch (1946) within his work on impression formation and in more recent literature surveys [Baumeister (2001); Rozin and Royzman (2001)] This bias moreover is consistent over a myriad of topics such as: social relations; emotions; mood; learning and even information processing; physiological arousal; and memory. In this seminar we examine studies across the domain of psychology and other disciplines to show that the phenomena is sufficiently ubiquitous so as to reflect and perhaps even explain the events sensed and perceived in our life space. Observe how the bad dominates the daily report in the media. What does this phenomenon mean with respect to the presence or absence of optimism and associated behavior, or for the conduct of child rearing or the power of the variable of happiness and other positive life circumstances? Moreover, an effort to find non-confirming data produces a negative result. No matter the variable studied bad exists at the center of our focus while good is relegated to the periphery. This is an upper college seminar for students of many disciplines. Class size: 10",

Sociologists study topics as varied as race, gender, class, religion, the birth of capitalism, democracy, education, crime and prisons, the environment, and inequality. At its most basic, the course will teach students how to read social science texts and evaluate their arguments. Conceptually, students will learn basic sociological themes and become familiar with how sociologists ask and answer questions. Most importantly, students will come away from the course with a new understanding of how to think sociologically about the world around them, their position in society, and how their actions both affect and are affected by the social structures in which we all live.

What are the sources of this inequality? Is social inequality inevitable? Is it undesirable? Through lectures, documentary films and discussions, this course examines the ways by which socially-defined categories of persons (e.g., women and men, Blacks and Whites, rich and poor, native- and foreign-born) are unevenly rewarded for their social contributions. Sociological theories are used to explain how and why social inequality is produced and maintained, and how it affects the well being of individuals and social groups. The course will focus on two general themes. The first deals with the structure of inequality while studying the unequal distribution of material and social resources (e.g., prestige, income, occupation). The second examines the processes that determine the allocation of people to positions in the stratification system (e.g. education, intelligence, parental wealth, gender, race). Class size: 18",

Beyond identifying the growing list of today\u2019s environmental difficulties, this course will challenge students to critically assess the relationship between society and the environment at local and global scales. We will do so by examining three topics that are central to environmental sociology. First, the course explores how people collectively understand and frame environmental issues. In other words, how do we know an environmental issue when we see one? Second, we will examine how the natural world and its changes shape social organization, the distribution of power, and decision-making. Third, we will analyze how social structures, political and economic institutions, and individual human actions produce and respond to environmental change. Students will learn about the unequal distribution of the benefits and burdens of environmental change, as well as the ways that people are responding to the many contemporary environmental challenges.

We then follow these conversations into the contemporary era, examining traditions such as functionalism, conflict theory, rational choice, symbolic interactionism, feminist theory, and critical theory, including thinkers such as G.H. Mead, Robert Merton, Pierre Bourdieu, JurgenHabermas, and Michel Foucault. Students will learn the key concepts of major theoretical approaches in sociology and will consider questions such as the relationship between theory and research, and the relationship of social conditions to the production of knowledge.

We will then examine institutional, social and cultural explanations for wealth creation, and explore the link between family background and privilege. Finally, we will assess the extent to which the wealthy and those less privileged differ in their work experiences, personality traits, social networks and consumption patterns.

It asks how sexual identities and social categories of sexuality come to be and how they are maintained or changed over time. It examines how historically specific social contexts shape the meaning of sexual experiences and how we use sexuality to define ourselves, produce social hierarchies, and mark moral boundaries. We will begin with an introduction to theories of sexuality and consider the essentialist / constructionist debate. Then we use a historical perspective to look at the social institutions that help to produce, construct, and control sexual practice and identities, paying special attention to the role of gender, race, and class inequality. This will provide a basis for looking at the development of modern sexual communities, identities, and politics, including controversies over commodified sexuality and feminist debates about prostitution and pornography. Throughout the course will consider the important role of gender in the social organization of sexuality. We will also address how these social processes shape notions of personal identity and the self. Class size: 22",

The course looks at recent and classic academic literature on: issue emergence; imperialism; discourse; and on what makes an NGO effective or ineffective. The students draw both on that literature and on their practical experience to discuss these issues. Additionally, the Core Seminar features a number of guest speakers to highlight the variety of ways one can become a practitioner of international affairs and discuss the real life implications of what we\u2019ve discussed in class; and hosts supplemental skill-building workshops to promote professional development. Students should expect to do 20-25 pages of formal academic writing, as well as: a multimedia presentation; written analysis of the competing stakeholders related to their internship organization; and a series of response papers throughout the course.Class size: 15",

On one level, this means that it is about something you do yourself all the time -- but we will be looking specifically at how analysis is produced for those who work in both the public and the private sectors and face critical political, investment, or even humanitarian decisions. Concentrating on three crucial components \u2013 collection, analysis and communications \u2013 the goal is understand processes behind the production of good analysis and the ways in which it can be conveyed to decision makers. At the same time as intensively studying some of the instances in which intelligence analysis has resulted in success -- and, because it tends to be more revealing, those where it has not -- we will be trying out some of the techniques involved in professional analysis, including writing, presentations, and team work, and looking at analysts working in the government, financial, and non-profit sectors. The intention is to offer an appreciation of what professional analysts do in an intelligence and political risk context, and how their work can feed into the conduct of international relations and international business.

This class focuses on the commissioning of large-scale representational architecture, the creation of public space, and the orchestration of streets at seven sites in continuous use since antiquity. By charting the chronological development of these sites, the class examines the ongoing dialogue between the past and present in Rome. Requirements include critical essays, presentations, and tests.

The course emphasizes how the study of antiquity gave birth both to archaeology (the study of the material remains of the past) and to art/architectural theory (the formulation of ideas for the future), while the study of anatomy and nature produced a new visual vocabulary. Beginning with Giotto, the class analyzes the contributions of Ghiberti, Brunelleschi, Masaccio, Donatello, Pierodella Francesca, Fra Angelico, Alberti, Botticelli, Sangallo, Mantegna, and Bellini. In addition to secondary scholarship, readings incorporate primary sources by Ghiberti, Piero, Alberti, and Vasari.

Throughout the 1960s and 70s, Dwan was one of the key galleries showing Minimalist and Land Art in America. In addition to Bard\u2019s resources, the course will also make use of other local sites, such as Dia: Beacon. The course will conclude by examining Minimalism's various afterlives.

Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company courses offered within the dance program, the course bases its motivating structure and principles on Jones\u2019 values as a choreographer and performer. Coursework is designed to prepare the dancer to deeply integrate technical ability and artistry, expanding the dancer\u2019s abilities to include fluid use of highly technical, improvisational, and analytical skills. Students must have a strong technical foundation, be self-motivated, and be capable of handling the demands of a four-day-a-week class. Readings, written assignments, and attendance at performances outside of regular class hours are essential aspects of the course, augmenting our intellectual understanding of technique and performance. Prerequisite: Prior enrollment in a BTJAZ technique course or permission of instructor. This class meets 4 days per week. Contact Leah Cox at btjaz@bard.edu with any questions. Class size: 20",

As a class, we will engage in collaborative methods by creating a work of live performance art together.

The filmmakers are most often (but not always) highly independent figures working away from the Hollywood system. The range moves from bold realism to a search for a continuity that mirrors the movement of interior consciousness. Largely the time period covered will be from the late fifties to the early seventies when there were a number of dynamic experiments in narrative, but we will also look at relatively contemporary work as well, including films by Bard faculty members. Films to be studied include those by Shirley Clarke, Michael Roemer, Adolfas Mekas, Curtis Harrington, Monte Hellman, Robert Frank, Yvonne Rainer, Charles Burnett, Julie Dash, David Lynch, Richard Linklater, Susan Seidelman, Jim Jarmusch and others. Three essays will be due throughout the semester. Class size: 25",

By fusing multiple forms of artistic tradition with a uniquely cinematic approach to space and time, Hou has produced a body of work that, through its stylistic originality and historical gravity, opens up new possibilities for the medium. Special attention will be paid to Hou\u2019s treatment of history, to questions of film style, and to the relationship between his work and that of other filmmakers. The course is synchronized with an international retrospective coordinated through the Center for Moving Image Arts, and we will study all of Hou Hsiao-hsien\u2019s films as well as works by directors such as Edward Yang, Fei Mu, Zhang Yimou, Jia Zhangke, Yasujiro Ozu, Hirokazu Koreeda, Robert Bresson, Pier Paolo Pasolini, and Olivier Assayas. Grades based on in-class discussion, short writing assignments, and a final research essay. Upper-college students who have taken courses in film criticism and history will have priority.

In addition to developing tools for listening to this complex polyphonic texture, through classroom experience with recordings, and attending concerts, we will read composers\u2019 letters such as Beethoven\u2019s Heiligenstadt testament,as well as articles from current publications including such authors as Alex Ross, Kyle Gann, Christopher Gibbs, and Richard Taruskin.

Through our exploration of the materiality and meaning of music, we will listen to wide-ranging examples of sounds from around the globe. We will consider ways to listen deeply and to write critically about music. We will examine how music has been represented in the past and how it is variously represented today, and will develop ethnographic research and writing skills. We will ask questions about the utility and value of music as a commodity in our everyday lives and in our globalized world. We will debate the ethics of musical appropriations and collaborations. We will examine both the foundational questions of the discipline (addressing debates about musical authenticity, musical origins, universals, comparative frameworks, and the preservationist ethos) as well as recent subjects of ethnomusicological concern. Topics will include: media and technology; post-colonial issues; music and language; hybridity; circulation and consumption; music and labor; music and gender; and the relevance of music to contemporary indigenous politics and human rights. Students are expected to read assigned readings in advance of class, participate in weekly discussions online and in class, take a midterm and final exam, and produce a variety of informal and formal written assignments (ranging from one-paragraph reading responses to two papers that are 5-7 pages in length).

In this course, we will read and listen to examples of musical exoticisms from around the globe, exploring the connections between stereotype, sound, and the (post-) colonial condition. From Herder\u2019s idealized \"folk\" to Malinowski\u2019s \"natives,\" from the ritual songs of Omaha Native Americans to Stravinsky\u2019s neo-primitivist ballets, from \"pygmy pop\" to the Eurovision Song Context, our class will trace how stereotypes of exoticism have appeared in a variety of musical traditions from the 18th century to the modern day.Modern political discourses of indigeneity seek to challenge and undo histories of \"otherness,\" yet indigenes must often struggle against the paradox of appearing \"inauthentic\" when they try to make a living from creative enterprises. We will explore this conundrum through classic texts on the anthropology of music, more recent works on postcolonialism and music, situating accounts of musical exoticism into the broader context of European imperialism. Along the way, we will listen to a wide variety of musics, exploring the logics of musical systems that were once labeled as \"primitive.\"Students will generate weekly discussion questions based on reading and listening assignments that will be posted online in advance of class meetings. There will be in-class midterm and final exams, and a variety of brief writing exercises in a range of informal and formal styles. Every week, selected students will be required to bring in an \"object\" to discuss in class, offering a brief presentation that explains the relevance of the object to our course\u2019s theme.

This seminar delves into Bach's life, his sizable musical family, and his creative influences. Some of his most revered compositions are analyzed and compared to other repertoire from the 17th and 18t h centuries. In addition, the course highlights landmark performances that served to promote Bach\u2019s greatness in following generations. Through the work of notable musicians \u2013 including Mendelssohn, Brahms, Albert Schweitzer, Stravinsky, Casals, Glenn Gould, Wendy Carlos, and John Eliot Gardiner-- the answer to \"Who was Bach?\" is seen to transform alongside the changing ideals of modern Western culture. Grades are determined through weekly reading and listening assignments, an exam, and a final project in which class members build an online Bach performance and research archive.

Starting with the \"Archduke\" Trio, this course will go through Beethoven's music of 1811 to 1827, his late period, with primary attention to how he increasingly molded all movements of a multi-movement form from a single idea, and also how he managed to overlay genres such as sonata form, variations, and fugue into a single movement, in a synthesizing apotheosis of classical form that no successor ever followed up on. In addition, we will also consider his minor works of the period- canons, folk song arrangements, marches- to gain a fuller view of what constituted a composer's daily life in the 1820s. The course is intended to satisfy a theory requirement for music majors, but might instead be used for a music history requirement if the student 's midterm and final papers take that approach.

        "department": "music",
        "description": "The decades from 1910 to 1970 saw an explosion of dissonance, complexity, and apparent musical chaos. And yet, beneath the surface it was also an era of unprecedented intricacy of structure and musical systematization. The liberation of dissonance and dissolution of melody left composers insecure, and they often compensated by creating systems of tremendous rigor not always apparent to the listener. This course will analyze in depth several works that changed the way we think about composing, and which pioneered the growth of an atonal musical language. Explore the cinematographic intercutting of Stravinsky's Le Sacre du Printemps; the tonal axis system of Bartok's Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion; the elegant number structures of Messiaen's\nQuartet for the End of Time; the delicate symmetries of Webern's Symphonie Op. 21; the total organization of Stockhausen's Gruppen; the fanatical precision of Babbitt's Post-Partitions; and the compelling multi tempo climaxes of Nancarrow's Study No. 36. Intended for music majors, but other strongly motivated students are welcome. Prerequisite: Theory 1 and 2 or the equivalent (ability to analyze tonal harmony). Class size: 22",

Studio projects will evolve from drawing and introductory modeling, ending in developed site-transformation concepts: The course will lead to proposals of practical and/or fantastical architectures at intersections of art and design. Students will research various sites, considering models that link the identity of place to its origins, and alternatively anticipating transitions into new, visionary modes of design through adaptation and intervention. We will examine a wide array of past and living examples through the presentation of projects, text, screenings and other materials. Students will develop their own plans individually and collaboratively, and will be encouraged to depart from traditional approaches to design to work from personal directives, improvisation and utopian vision. Weekly projects will lead to a developed proposal for situating your program in a specific site; research can include a range of materials; found (historic, inspirational) images, text, original drawings, diagrams, objects, maps, models and other relevant artifacts.

The issues discussed in Painting I, mainly the language of color, value, temperature, contrast, saturation, intensity, etc. and strong structural relationships, will serve as building blocks for complex figurative compositions. We will be also working from reproductions as we study some of the great figurative masters. Students will be expected to be on time and have the proper equipment.

Students will be working on gessoed paper over the first weeks but should know how to stretch and prime a canvas properly. Some of the poses will extend over two weeks, which will allow students to begin to push their work into new places. This class is for students who want to work hard and extend themselves.

This show focused on a number of artists who worked in large loft studios and experimented with ideas, materials and processes. In this level 2 Sculpture class, students will use the UBS Red Hook Barn Studio to work on projects that take up space. In the first half of the semester, we will look at work from this show and examine some of the ideas that these Process/Materials artists used forty years ago. This will in turn lead us to think about ways of working that are specific to the time that we are living in now. In the second half of the semester, we will turn from this historical approach in order to work on something more timeless, but no less space-consuming: a mini golf course, in which each student will design, construct (and play) one hole. One of the goals will be to draw on what was learned in the first half and apply it to this large second half project. Requirement: Sculpture 1 or by permission of the instructor. Class size: 14",

We will discuss light and air, weight, gravity, speed and tensions while addressing problems of scale and the potential power and pressure of how mark-making possibilities by using different materials (charcoal, pencils, cut paper, black and white acrylic paint) to create harmony that resonates throughout the composition. Great drawings and paintings of the past will be looked at and discussed and the importance of drawing through the ages considered. On occasion students will work from reproductions of master works. There will be assignments and critiques usually toward the end of the session. Class time is reserved for hard work. Class size: 14",

A traditional print may just be ink on paper, but artists have pushed that boundary beyond sculpture, employ mass reproduction techniques or print with everyday materials. This class will question the traditional notion of printmaking and allow students to explore its boundaries. The first part of the semester will mix technical exploration with theoretical assignments, the second part of the semester consists of a final project.

Out of this research will emerge many notes, sketches and plans, done in various mediums, sizes, styles and approaches. The goal will be for each student to start a collection of images for future work. As the semester progresses, students will begin to make more complex work. They will start to imagine where this research could lead them. Fictions: for the second half of the semester, students will begin to translate their works into larger, more complex pieces. There will also be opportunities for various forms of collaboration. The final project will focus on the process of transformation. For example, the work might get bigger, turning into a construction of many elements. But they could also move in another direction, towards a deconstruction or even something more simplified and abstract. Requirement: Drawing 2 or Painting 2, or by permission of the instructor.

This course will investigate selected periods in world theater, beginning with the massive communal festivals of ancient Greece and culminating in the philosophical upheavals of the Enlightenment. Paying close attention to connections between drama, stagecraft, and modes of spectatorship, we will ask how the theater has shored up political power; how the stage has served as a scale model for the known world; and what has been at stake in changing notions of classicism. Through analytical essays, class presentations, and a final performance project, we will cultivate a critical vocabulary for discussing theaters of the past\u2014and discover their often-surprising legacies in modern and contemporary performance.

Between the early nineteenth century and the mid-twentieth century, political revolutions and social upheavals challenged deep-seated assumptions about history, society, and the private life. Modern playwrights, in turn, began to alter the molecular makeup of drama, unraveling traditional modes of understanding narrative, illusion, and character, and writing plays that could respond to\u2014and create\u2014a modern world. This course will survey modern European and American drama, examining questions of realism and symbolism; the writing and staging of revolution and social history; subjectivity, illusion, and anti-theatricality. Playwrights under discussion will include B\u00fcchner, Ibsen, Strindberg, Chekhov, Stein, Wilder, Williams, Genet, Brecht, and Beckett. Students will write a midterm and a final essay, and make an in-class presentation linking works of modern drama to developments in the visual arts, film, or social and political life.

The semester begins with stretch and placement techniques and core work to develop a neutral and ready body, followed by a sequence of impulse-based improvisation techniques enabling students to find authentic movement and push past their physical limitations. These improvisations will lead into original phrase work, training students to develop their own unique choreographic and performance styles. The second half of the semester is focused on writing composition.Students will complete timed writing exercises in class, designed to free the creative voice, and will then be given individual guidance and dramaturgical assignments, leading to the development and performance of an original text and movement score.",

Working collaboratively or individually, students will develop performance material based on specific iconographic characters, such as artists, historical figures, movie stars, fairy tales, or myths. By identifying, isolating, amplifying, and re-configuring their essential characteristics, we will aim to give these icons unanticipated performance life through a unified combination of visuals, text, movement, video and sound. This process will begin with a research phase, with group viewing and discussion of performance documentation, imagery, and writing by performers, artists, creators, and filmmakers who have found inspiration articulating character from specific sources, including the Wooster Group, Charles Ludlam, James Franco, Isaac Julien, Kazuo Ohno, and Eleanor Antin, followed by group discussions of this material. Students will then participate in weekly exercises that will explore how the primary tools of the performer\u2019s body, with its visual, kinetic, vocal, and dynamic possibilities, augmented by the addition of production tools such as props, lighting music and soundtrack, and projection design can create character through a focused idea. As the development phase continues students will keep weekly journals and give work-in-progress presentations, and the class will culminate in a final performance in a black box, gallery space, or site-specific locations.

Is civic duty to be preferred to individual love, as Virgil is usually read as suggesting? Is the straight path of epic to be chosen over the wandering itinerary of romance? Are the transcendent truths of Empire and Church to be pursued over the immediate experiences of private life? Medieval literature, with its idealization of courtly ladies and knights errant, is often seen as taking the side of Dido, while Renaissance literature, with its self-conscious return to antique ideals, is usually said to champion Aeneas. With this framework in mind, we will read St. Augustine's Confessions, troubadour lyrics, Dante's Inferno, the Arthurian romance Lancelot of the Lake, Petrarch's Canzoniere, and Tasso's Jerusalem Delivered.

Against this background, our main interest in the first half of the semester is love poetry and religious poetry including Jonson, Donne, Herbert, Traherne, Vaughan and Milton.

What was ancient comedy, and how did it evolve? What was its legacy, and how do its concerns relate to the role played by comedy in our lives today? With mythical heroes, wily slaves, and singing frogs as our guides, we will travel to Athens and Rome by way of Hades and Cloudcuckooland to explore how the ancient comic theater played the part of carnivalesque ritual, penetrating political and social satire, or utopian fantasy. We will trace comic traditions from Aristophanes\u2019 theater of the absurd, through the social dramas of Menander, to the metatheater of the Roman playwrights Plautus and Terence. By reading a selection of plays in light of their ancient and modern performance contexts, we will explore the shifting boundaries between ancient and modern notions of theatricality, genre, humor, society, and the self.

How has nature been narrated, harnessed and reimagined at varying moments and locations, and how have the values assigned to it been deployed in the construction of national identity and in the processes of modernity? Exploring the tensions in the environment as an object of aesthetic appreciation as well as a potentially destructive force, our examination will also extend to varying political, social, religious, and ethical dimensions of the human responses to the lived environment, including what the natural environment and disasters can teach us. In the wake of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, we will also be asking how attentions and concerns about environment have been raised and redirected, and will explore the emerging literary responses that have sought to grapple with life in an entirely changed landscape. Readings include a variety of fictional and nonfictional texts from the eighth century to the present, including classical court poetry, Matsuo Basho, Miyazawa Kenji, Kawabata Yasunari, Oe Kenzaburo, Kawakami Hiromi, ecofeminist critics, Okinawan poetry, and an Ainu memoir.

From literary modernism to pragmatism to post-structuralism to personal computing, the interpretation and imagination of \"Asia\" and its traditions, art, and literature has played a key role in the evolution of Western aesthetic movements. Likewise, meetings between Asian, American, and European writers, artists, and thinkers have served to mediate the experience and shape of modernity in the East. Although many of these movements could be characterized as \"exoticist\" or \"Orientalist,\" this class aims to take seriously the ways in which the representation and mutual mis-representation of the East in the West has structured modern and contemporary ideas of language, visuality, space, and self. Readings include Okakura, Fenollosa, Waley, Pound, Kuki, Heidegger, Suzuki, Snyder, Chao, Buck, and Barthes, among others.

A premium will be placed on student participation in class discussion, and each student will be asked to present a book of the poem (focusing on structural analysis, interpretative issues, etc.) to the class.At least two papers, midterm, final exam.This course is designed particularly for first-year students.

Alongside poems by both major and lesser known figures, we will ponder questions about poetics both from the period and from our own moment in critical history. What does it mean for poetry to be a kind of \"making\"\u2014what materials does poetry use, and what logic does it follow? What makes a love poem successful? How did the art of poetry change over the course of the Renaissance? While developing skills like close reading and historical contextualization, we will also explore how and why these 400 year old poems still manage to offer us delight and surprise. Class size: 18",

Given that these theories involved, for each, a commitment to literary expression, we will pay special attention to the aesthetic choices they make as writers. We will also place them in historical context: one begins writing in the years leading up to the Civil War, the other in the wake of Reconstruction's failure. What changes in the U.S. over this span? What doesn't? Readings will include Douglass\u2019s 1845 narrative, the expanded autobiography My Bondage and My Freedom, and a number of his lectures; and they'll include Du Bois\u2019s opusThe Souls of Black Folk as well as his lesser-known sociological writing and fiction, such as the 1911 novel The Quest of the Silver Fleece.

        "description": "All tragedies see the human condition as doomed; but in classical Greek tragedy the protagonist's fate, usually signified by an oracle, is externalized as something beyond human control, whereas in modern tragedy, starting with Shakespeare and his contemporaries, fate is more or less internalized as a flaw in the protagonist's character. Since then the modern protagonist has increasingly been seen as a helpless victim of circumstance, a scapegoat. Fate is sometimes externalized as history, war, or society, sometimes internalized, but in either case the protagonist has been reduced in stature, so that 20th century tragedy can only be called ironic--a far cry from the heroic tragedy of ancient Greece. In tracing this complex history, including the disappearance and revival of the chorus, we will examine tragedies by Aeschylus, Sophocles, Marlowe, Shakespeare, Dostoyevsky (his novel Crime and Punishment), Ibsen, Strindberg, O'Neill, Brecht, Sartre, and Miller, all of which will be scrutinized in the light of major theories by Aristotle, Hegel, Nietzsche, Kierkegaard, and others.

        "department": "lit2courses",
        "description": "Cross-listed: American Studies American poetry found its own voice in the first half of the 19th century when Emerson challenged American \"scholars\" to free themselves from tradition. For the next three generations most of the major poets, from Walt Whitman to Robert Frost and Wallace Stevens, acknowledged Emerson as a crucial inspiration. Emerson himself and two of his contemporaries, Longfellow and Edgar Allan Poe, were the first to achieve international fame, but it was in Whitman's poems that a distinctively American voice was first heard--a voice that was both oracular and plain-spoken. At the same time, the oddly metered, introspective poems of Emily Dickinson, mostly unpublished during her lifetime, spoke in a New England voice that was no less distinctive and no less American. Then, only thirty years after her death, the powerful modern voices of T.S. Eliot, Wallace Stevens, Ezra Pound, H.D., Marianne Moore, William Carlos Williams, Robinson Jeffers, E.E. Cummings, and Hart Crane began to be heard. We will read selective poems by each of these, and we will also give equal time to Frost, the great contrarian poet who was dismissed by some as anti-modern but is now acknowledged as one of the greatest.

This course will offer a survey of the modern Egyptian novel, a survey that simultaneously maps the changing cityscape of Egypt\u2019s bulging metropolis, allowing for an examination of the developments and transformations of both during the course of the 20th century. Once considered the center of the Arab world, Cairo has witnessed repeated shifts in its regional and global position and importance over the last century. However, it continues to play a lead role in much of Egyptian literary (and cultural) production. From Naguib Mahfouz\u2019s iconic alley to Sonallah Ibrahim\u2019s apartment building, to HamdiAbu Golayyel\u2019s multifamily tenement, students will engage with novels that demonstrate a vast range of literary representations by Cairo\u2019s writers, from its shifting centers, to its ever expanding margins. Through close readings of these texts, we will consider the socioeconomic and political conditions that have impacted and radically restructured the city during its recent history, and the ways in which such changes are manifested in its novelists\u2019 stylistic and aesthetic choices.

        "department": "lit2courses",
        "description": "This course offers a critical introduction to the literature produced in Britain at the time of the Industrial Revolution, the French Revolution, and the Napoleonic wars. The term traditionally used to categorize this literature, \"romantic,\" is interestingly problematic: throughout the course we will question the assumptions built into this term instead of assuming that we know what it means or taking for granted a series of supposed characteristics of \"romantic\" literature and art. We will also explore the extent to which key conflicts in British culture during the \"romantic period,\" including the founding of the United States, independence movements in the Americas, the development of free trade ideology, and the debates over slavery and colonialism, are still at issue today. The centerpiece of this course is the close reading of poetry. There will also be a strong emphasis on the historical and social contexts of the works we are reading, and on the specific ways in which historical forces and social changes shape and are at times shaped by the formal features of literary texts. The question of whether \"romantic\" writing represents an active engagement with or an escapist idealization of the important historical developments in this period will be a continuous focus. Readings include canonical and non-canonical authors: William Blake, William Wordsworth, Helen Maria Williams, Thomas Beddoes, Anna Letitia Barbauld, Robert Southey, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Percy Bysshe Shelley, John Keats, Lord Byron, John Clare, and Laetitia Elizabeth Landon.

Topics will include psychoanalysis and childhood subjectivity, empire, primitivism, gender performativity, Afrofuturism, post-9/11 paranoia, and the military-entertainment complex. We will read texts by authors including Suzanne Collins, Neil Gaiman, Ursula Le Guin, C.S. Lewis, Nnedi Okorafor-Mbachu, Tamora Pierce, Philip Pullman, J.R.R. Tolkien, and J.K. Rowling.

        "department": "lit2courses",
        "description": "Cross-listed: Irish & Celtic StudiesThroughout the 20th century, Ireland and its \"Troubles\" represented what many believed to be one of the most intractable and seemingly irresolvable cases of hatred and conflict in the world. Violence and internecine warfare had often characterized its 800 year relationship with Britain. Sectarian hatred between Roman Catholics and Protestants, as well as conflicts within these groups, and the cultural and political divisions between North and South, were entrenched. Constitutional politicians battled with paramilitary groups to define a complex discourse based on ancient enmity. Terrorism and violence to a large extent shaped the rest of the world's perception of Ireland, particularly Northern Ireland--a view complicated by the perspectives of a global Irish diaspora formed in the wake of centuries of immigration. In this course, we will explore the historical roots and cultural imagination of this long-standing strain of hatred and attempts to move beyond it in Ireland. Iconic events--the Easter Rising, a war of independence and the violence of the Black and Tans, civil war, Bloody Sunday, hunger strikes at Long Kesh (Maze Prison)--combined with the enduring trope of \"blood sacrifice\" to shape this cultural imaginary. How have works of art (poetry, plays, song, film) and popular culture (Gaelic games, the \"Orange\" marches) served to stimulate and define hatred as well as to overcome the human drive toward aggression and hostility? How did History figure into the cultural production of 20th century Irish Nationalists and Republicans, Unionists and Loyalists? From the standpoint of history, how did these myths obscure other realities now available to us? Careful study of speeches, memoir, and political documents will allow us to examine the functioning of \"languages of hatred\" as well as the movement to lay to rest and move beyond such languages after the Belfast \"Good Friday\" Agreement of 1998 and its implementation in 2007. In many ways, the course will culminate in this recent history of conflict: a deep study of the Good Friday negotiations reveals not the triumph of love over hatred, but rather a story of how an agreement is thrashed out by those who hate each other, followed by the story of its implementation and how to make such an agreement work in practice. We will examine the importance of culture in changing political life even as we recognize the persistence of affective memory in present-day Northern Ireland. What does it mean to live in a \"post-hatred\" environment? Does hate ever really go away? Class size: 22",

It was a time when barriers of all sorts began to crumble\u2014barriers between past and present, foreground and background, high and low culture, beauty and ugliness, good and evil. Artists and writers responded in many different ways across the world. The writers we will read in this class represent the fulcrum of creativity in America, Central or Eastern Europe and Russia. Each lived at a different axis of modernity\u2014where East met West, where the Russian Revolution provided a vibrant but terrifying image of liberation, where modern technological innovation produced endless possibilities of satirization of both the old world and the new, where ethnic and genocidal violence was developing under the surface of this innovation into the foreseeable European Holocaust. These writers have something powerful and unique to say about the advent of the modern period in the fantastic parallel worlds they created where machines take on lives of their own, grotesque transformations violate the laws of science, and inversions of normality become the norm. Through their fantastic conceptions a vision of modernity emerges which questions the most basic presumptions of western civilization\u2014in art, morality, politics, the psyche and social life\u2014a vision for which the West still has no satisfying response. All readings are in English. We will read The Marvelous Land of Oz (L. Frank Baum), The Metamorphosis (Kafka), RUR (Capek), War with the Newts (Capek), Street of Crocodiles (Schulz), Sanatorium Under the Sign of the Hour Glass (Schulz), Envy (Olesha) The Bedbug (Mayakovsky).

They will meet with students in this course for an extended workshop to discuss their plays, poetics, and collaborative works-in-progress.\nDorst and Ehler\u2019s oeuvre includes Merlin, a re-writing of the King Arthur legend; Toller, a play based on the life of the Socialist revolutionary Ernst Toller; and Ice Age, a chilling one-act about the Fascist-friendly literary Nobel Laureate Knut Hamsun. In each of these, Dorst and Ehler explore the fraught intersection of the imaginative and the political worlds. Alongside four plays and one prose book (This Beautiful Place) by Dorst and Ehler, we will also study their source materials, focusing our inquiry on their creative process, in preparation for our work with the artists in person.

We will find out how characters enact our contemporary concerns with issues like politics, sexuality, gender, and race, but also how they appeared within their own historical framework. For instance, knowing how limited the prospects of early modern European women were, even aristocrats, creates new admiration for Shakespeare\u2019s bold and quirky comic heroines. Our primary focus is literary, but we will draw on critical readings, theater history, film and performance work. Plays to be read include A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream, Romeo and Juliet, 1 Henry IV, As You Like It, Hamlet, Othello, and The Tempest. Open to all students. This course counts as pre-1800 offering.

And what can this effort to represent injustice, suffering, or resistance tell us about about fiction and literature? This course will focus on a wide range of fictions, from a variety of writers with different backgrounds, that tell unusual stories about the rights of individuals and communities to justice. We will read novels addressing human migration, injustices committed in the name of the state against a minority, and the harsh conditions under which some communities operate as part of their survival strategy, among other topics. We will look at the ways in which literary forms can allow universalizing claims to be made, exploring how racism, disenfranchisement, poverty, and lack of access to education and health care, for instance, can affect the dignity of all humans. Readings may include: Chronicles of a Death Foretold by Garcia Marquez; Snow Falling on Cedars by David Guterson; Smilla\u2019s Sense of Snow by Peter Hoeg; Our Nig by Harriet Wilson; Balzac & the Chinese Seamstress by Sijai Dai; Winter is in the Blood by James Welch ; The Way to Rainy Mountain by N. Scott Momaday; Wolves of the Crescent Moon by Yousef Al-Mohaimeed, and Bound to Violence by Yambo\nOuleguem. We will also watch a number of films based on the novels (including Chronicles, Smilla's Sense, Balzac, Snow Falling), and The First Grader (2001, on the right to education in Kenya). ",

These writers address the changes and social upheavals occurring in the subcontinent, much of which may be traced to the Partition of India in 1947. We will find that not only do these works of fiction confront the political, social and cultural issues and upheavals of the century with exemplary sophistication, but they also conjure up a subcontinent that is real, fantastical and with magical qualities.

Norton and Co. \u2013 an arbiter of the canon in English \u2013 issued a two-volume Anthology of Literature by Women. Among other things, this publication provokes the knee-jerk question, is there a companion Norton Anthology of Literature by Men? (There is not.) The sheer existence of such a collection also throws into relief other, more pressing questions, though: for instance, who is the intended audience and what is their presumed taste in books? Is literature by women so extricable from its larger contexts, so separable from its various contents that authorial gender suffices as a uniting rubric? What is women\u2019s writing? And, for that matter, what is men\u2019s writing? Do these categories of gender and taste hold for today\u2019s audiences? Did they ever? Such questions are especially relevant to our present moment in which categories of gender and identity are being overwritten and expanded both colloquially and legally. In this course, we\u2019ll consider literary notions of gender and identity that alternatively reflect and distort our world, and we\u2019ll explore how gender is defined, catered to, and productively complicated through readings that will include some of the earliest texts written by women; early examples of the \"advice\" genre (including texts that offer solicited and unsolicited advice to everyone from female monarchs to anchoresses); and texts in which male authors ventriloquize women, and vice versa.

        "description": "Over the past several decades the critical boundaries between literary novels and genre fiction have become\u2014as the result of ambitious work by various innovative, pioneering writers\u2014increasingly ambiguous. The earliest gothicists framed their tales within the metaphoric scapes of ruined abbeys and diabolic grottoes, chthonic settings populated by protagonists whose inverted psyches led them to test the edges of propriety and sanity. Masters such as Angela Carter, William Gaddis, and Cormac McCarthy, while embracing this same fundamentally dark artistic vision, have radically reinvented and contemporized tropes, settings, and narrative arcs to create a new phase in this historic tradition. This movement, identified as the New Gothic, appears to have risen in tandem with a parallel literary phenomenon, which for the purposes of this course is termed New Wave Fabulism, whose achievement is to have taken the genre of fantasy/horror in a similar literary direction. While not breaking allegiance with the fundamental spirit that animates its genre counterparts, writers such as John Crowley, Kelly Link, and Elizabeth Hand are creating a body of serious literary fiction that deserves critical examination. Among others we will read are Robert Coover, Brian Evenson, Karen Russell, and Peter Straub. One or two authors will join us in class to discuss their work with students and give a reading.

Rather than thinking of structure as an imposition, we\u2019ll consider it an aid to the freeing of the imagination. Along the way we\u2019ll encounter such aspects of poetic form as: patterns of repetition; the infinite varieties of syntax, punctuation, meter, and typography; the \"color\" of vowels; and the rhythmic implications of word choice and sentence structure. Participants will explore a range of techniques and materials from around the world and from the beginning of recorded history right up to the present moment.

Words do not resemble things, and so writers must find ways to conjure material presences in the mind\u2019s eye. Beginning with the grapheme and glyph, we will examine figures such as image, metaphor, simili and metonymy; ideas of description and depiction, mimesis and ekphrasis, and the complex relation between verbal particulars and abstraction. We will ask questions about the difference between a blank page and a screen, and contemplate the ways in which the digital age has altered our sense of near and far, the tactile and the corporeal; how the emphasis on visual information alters our relation to memory and knowledge. We will consider the possible connection between the aesthetics of visuality and the Western bourgeois culture of desire.

Throughout the semester, we will discuss the mechanics of literary community building, from submitting, interning, blogging, tweeting (one recent editor of the Paris Review Daily maintains a twitter feed about all things Pym), forming literary chat rooms and real life book clubs. We will consider strategies for sustainable engagement with the reading and writing students have cherished at Bard, extending into their twenties and far beyond.

In view of this dialogue between pre-modern and modern culture, this course eschews a chronological coverage of Chinese literature and culture that proceeds from one dynasty or time period to the next. Instead, it will focus on touchstone texts from pre-modern literary Chinese traditions, and then attend to how this cultural legacy is drawn upon, appropriated, and re-invented in contemporary cinema. Canonical texts include poetry, historical writings, and fictional narratives. We will focus on films made by some of the most influential directors including Wong Kar-wai, Ang Lee, Zhang Yimou, Jia Zhangke, and Lu Chuan. In every unit, we examine contemporary films alongside classical texts, guided by critical inquiries that look at how reading practices structure interpretation, how myths are framed, and how personal and cultural memory works. For example, we begin with Sima Qian\u2019s (2nd c. BCE) seminal historical narratives and biographies on the founding of the first Chinese empires, and then turn to two contemporary films\u2014Zhang Yimou\u2019s Hero (2002) and Lu Chuan\u2019s King\u2019s Feast (2012)\u2014to consider how they transform the earlier materials, retell the imperial past, and work as commentaries on the present-day Chinese state.

A premium will be placed on student participation in class discussion, and each student will be asked to present a book of the poem (focusing on structural analysis, interpretative issues, etc.) to the class.At least two papers, midterm, final exam.This course is designed particularly for first-year students.

Athenian political, artistic, literary, and intellectual traditions continue to reverberate through the world today: democracy, tragedy and comedy, rhetoric, philosophy, history, as well as the classical style of sculpture and architecture stem from this remarkable culture. The course will confront some of the ambiguities and tensions (slavery, exclusion of women and non-citizens from political power), as well as the glories, of Athenian art, literature, and history during this period.

        "department": "classic",
        "description": "Linguists and archaeologists have a rough agreement that there existed a people speaking a language called Proto-Indo-European (PIE), unattested itself but linguistically reconstructable from cognate features in a number of languages covering a geographical spread from Sanskrit to Old Irish. There is little consensus about that people\u2019s original homeland, or the timing or causes for its migrations as far as the Indus Valley at one extreme and Ireland at the other. What can be agreed upon most readily from the linguistic evidence of this band of Indo-European cultures is that they shared not merely a common language and social structures but also common literary genres, principally epic and lyric, in which there are signs of common metaphors and even meters. Hence it is possible (without adopting any one theory about PIE history) to compare passages from epics originating in oral traditions and later crystallized into such texts as the Mahabharata and Ramayana in India, the Iliad and the Odyssey in Greece, the Norse Elder Edda, and the Irish T\u00e1in B\u00f3 Cuailnge. We will read selections from these areas and try to isolate cognate features, on the level of rhythm, diction, tropes, religious and military practices, and narrative structures, and read some of the principal secondary literature of Indo-European comparatists. We will then further try to formulate what may have been distinctive about each epic tradition\u2019s evolution. All texts will be read in English, with occasional glances at metrical and linguistic features of the originals. Class size: 15",

        "description": "\"Enchanting, brimming with wonder and magic, the fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm are the special stories of childhood that stay with us throughout our lives,\" writes translator and Grimm scholar Jack Zipes. Unfortunately, we seem to know these tales only in adaptations that greatly reduce their power to touch our emotions and engage our imaginations. Through a close reading of selected tales, with emphasis on language, plot, motif, and image, this course explores not only the tales\u2019 poetics and politics but also their origins in the oral tradition, in folklore and myth. The course considers major critical approaches (e.g., Freudian, Marxist, feminist) and conducts a contrastive analysis of creative adaptations (Disney, classical ballet, postmodern dance) and other fairy-tale traditions (Perrault, Straparola, Arabian Nights). Creative and critical writing assignments. Conducted in German. First year students with should consult with Prof. Kempf for eligibility. Class size: 18",

Is humor a thought or a sentiment? Poetry and philosophy have for centuries offered fascinating responses to such questions\u2014 not least in the German tradition. Poets, philosophers, and poetic thinkers\u2014from Goethe, Kant, and Schiller, to H\u00f6lderlin, Heidegger, and Rilke, or from Heine, Nietzsche, and Kafka, to writers of the Avant-Garde, and on to Benjamin, Brecht, and Arendt\u2014have all had something to say on these questions. The beauty and precision of their language(s) will foster our analytical vocabulary and will (we hope!) inspire ambitious and playful writing experiments and provoke a semester of joyful conversations with these thinkers of and in the German language.

But recent years have witnessed the resurgence of compelling work by new Italian directors, especially in films about the cultural changes created in Italy by the major waves of immigration from Asia, Northern Africa, and Eastern Europe. This course will focus on engaging works of contemporary Italian cinema, with special attention given to such themes as immigration; politics and corruption; work and social conditions; family and society.

We will complement the study of the texts with interviews, videos, articles and other authentic material about the composers and the specific issues that songs refer to.

        "description": "Cross-listed: LAIS \"America is an Essay,\" writes Germ\u00e1n Arciniegas in the vein of Michel de Montaigne\u2019s Essais (1580), in which the essay is conceived as a literary genre for reflection, hybrid experimentation and the formulation of ideas. Anticipating independence from Spain after a long colonial period, writers in the American hemisphere used the form of the essay to imagine what the possibilities of an emerging \"Latin America\" could be. Throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, issues of citizenship, nationhood, collective values and identity have been re-framed and rethought by a long line of thinkers, including: Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, Andr\u00e9s Bello, Sim\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez, Esteban Echeverr\u00eda, Domingo F. Sarmiento, Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed, Jos\u00e9 Enrique Rod\u00f3, Jos\u00e9 Carlos Mari\u00e1tegui, Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos, Roberto Fern\u00e1ndez\nRetamar, Octavio Paz and Eduardo Galeano. Tropes and expectations emerging from Western Enlightenment and Modernity are mapped onto the foundations of Nationhood and Citizenship. This attempt to inscribe foundational models will be tried out and ripped apart in writing, as history and human experience force abstract conceptualizations of identity to be continually re-assessed locally. Theodor Adorno, Georg Luk\u00e1cs, Walter Mignolo, Julio Ramos and others will provide the theoretical framework to situate the genre of the Latin American essay within a broader discussion of this literary form.

This course is intended for sophomore and junior biology majors, although it is open to students of all years. One objective of the course is to provide biology majors the statistical background they need to analyze data for their own senior research; biology students should take this course before their senior year, if possible. Notice, though, that the topics in this course are applicable to many advanced courses.

This introductory level course focuses on climate change as a key driver of environmental change. We will explore the effects of climate change on the ecology of animals, plants, and microbes, including biodiversity and ecosystem function, but will also include discussion on how these biologically oriented questions relate to the interconnected issues of human society, politics, and the economy. In addition, we will focus on relevant physical topics including the astronomical basis for natural variation in climate (years to eons), basics of global weather (e.g. gyres and Hadley cells), glacial cycles and marine circulation. In the laboratory portion of the course students will analyze ice core data, and use a bevy of tools to predict changes in the timing of migration in birds and butterflies, and predict how climate change will affect the distribution and range of plant and animal species. This course is appropriate for students interested in continuing their studies in biology, and also for motivated students whose primary interest is in other disciplines. Class size: 18",

This course takes a modern approach to the study of genetics in which classical ideas about genotype, phenotype and inheritance are integrated into the modern molecular and genomic understanding of the processes involved in the generation of diversity. In addition to discussions of the molecular mechanisms involved in DNA replication, recombination, the generation and repair of mutations, and the relationship between genotype and phenotype, special consideration is given to our understanding of the processes involved in generating population-level variation in complex traits and how this understanding can help us identify the myriad genetic and non-genetic factors influencing these traits. The laboratory consists of a semester long project involving the genetic manipulation of a model organism\u2019s genome to address one or more topics in the course. . This is a writing intensive course. Regular short writing assignments will be required, along with two 10-page essays (see below). We will meet for weekly hour-long writing labs.

In this course, we will study cognitive and social development from an evolutionary perspective such as the evolution of thought or language. We will also explore how evolutionary theory can be applied to understanding of human preferences and behavior including but not limited to: mate preferences, mating strategies, kin relationships, cooperation, conflict, aggression and warfare.

In this seminar, we will explore the ways in which large swaths of mental processes and behavior operate outside of conscious awareness. We will begin with the history of these ideas but place a special focus on the empirical research of the past 40 years. After reading work in cognitive psychology that introduces us to foundational concepts such as implicit learning, memory, and perception (i.e., subliminal perception), we will spend the bulk of our time engaging with how these processes unfold in our social worlds (e.g., attitudes, prejudices, emotions, goals, self-esteem, and relationships). We will conclude by considering the implications of this research for notions of free will and individual responsibility. Readings will draw from cognitive, social, and clinical psychology as well as neuroscience and philosophy. Prerequisites: 1.

More recent interests center on mind-body relations and embodiment, and on bodies as targets for the production of consumer desires and sites of commodification and political control. This course will explore a range of different issues raised by these perspectives through readings theorizing the body, supplemented by comparative ethnographic studies of bodily knowledge and practice. We will view bodies as sites of negotiation and resistance and contextualize them within local and global political economies and systems of power. Topics will include the gendering of bodies and other culturally constructed markings of social class, race, age; decisions concerning fertility and reproduction; manipulation of bodily surfaces and forms to establish boundaries and identities through techniques such as tattooing, piercing, dieting, sculpting and cosmetic surgery; commodification and fragmentation of the body through the selling and transplantation of body parts; and the blurring of body/non-body and human/non-human boundaries under the impact of new technologies.

In what ways has violence become naturalized in the contemporary world? In this course, we will consider how acts of violence challenge and support modern ideas of humanity, raising important questions about what it means to be human today. These questions lie at the heart of anthropological thinking and also structure contemporary discussions of human rights. Anthropology\u2019s commitment to \"local culture\" and cultural diversity has meant that anthropologists often position themselves in critical opposition to \"universal values,\" which have been used to address various forms of violence in the contemporary world. The course will approach different forms of violence, including ethnic and communal conflicts, colonial education, torture and its individualizing effects, acts of terror and institutionalized fear, and rituals of bodily pain that mark individuals\u2019 inclusion or exclusion from a social group. The course is organized around three central concerns. First, we will discuss violence as a means of producing and consolidating social and political power, and exerting political control. Second, we will look at forms of violence that have generated questions about \"universal rights\" of humanity versus culturally specific practices, such as widow burning in India and female genital mutilation in postcolonial Africa. In these examples, we explore gendered dimensions in the experience of violence among perpetrators, victims, and survivors. Finally, we will look at the ways human rights institutions have sought to address the profundity of human suffering and pain, and ask in what ways have they succeeded and/or failed. Readings will range from theoretical texts, anthropological ethnographies, as well as popular representations of violence in the media and film. Class size: 22",

It has also been critical to the sorting, surveiling, managing and mobilizing techniques used by colonial and post-colonial regimes. Meanwhile nature, culture\u2019s doppleganger, has been quietly at work \"purifying\" the category of \"culture\" from the objects and processes assumed to be external to it. This course brings \"nature\" out of culture\u2019s shadows in order to examine how ideas about nature and the natural have shaped social scientific and historical scholarship on, and political and cultural formations within, the modern Middle East. We will investigate the relationship between nature and power in contexts of empire, decolonization and postcoloniality. Under the broad term \"nature\" we will consider such diverse topics as kinship, nationalism, violence, technology, war, race, gender, sexuality, environmentalism, fossil fuels and genetics. What role do genetics play in twenty-first century Middle East politics? How have practices of \"taming\" and managing nature and its resources shaped the parameters within which political authority\u2014and revolution\u2014can emerge? What can the study of the Middle East tell us about the extent to which homosexuality is a biological universal? What are the tensions between the idea of competing \"environmental imaginaries\" and theories that the nonhuman environment (e.g. rivers, dams, mosquitoes) has helped determine political, social and economic outcomes in the Middle East?

What is the relationship between nuclear testing and climate change? How have nuclear disasters changed the meanings of biological risk, biosecurity and governmental uncertainty? Is there an affect particular to the nuclear age? How has citizenship been transformed in proximity to nuclear toxicity? Can nature be nuclear?

Required of all anthropology majors, this course will also be of interest to students wishing to explore critical innovations in the study of local, national, and mass culture around the world. In contrast to early anthropological focus on seemingly isolated, holistic cultures, more recent studies have turned their attention to contest within societies and the intersection of local systems of meaning with global processes of politics, economics and history. The class will be designed around an influential social theorist, such as Bourdieu, Bakhtin, or Marx, and the application of their theories by anthropologists, such as Aihwa Ong, Judith Irvine, or Michael Taussig. The seminar will involve participation from all of the faculty in the anthropology department. It aims to inspire critical engagement with an eye towards developing theoretical tools and questions for a senior project that makes use of contemporary theories of culture.

The course will examine different monetary systems in modern market economies: including gold standard episodes, money in the American colonies, sovereign currency regimes, monetary unions as in the EU, local currency areas, and emerging phenomena like bitcoin and peer-to-peer payment systems.

Most introductory textbooks begin by characterizing the processes and outcomes of complex markets involving exchanges of goods and money among millions of \"agents\" (households and firms), which are implicitly assumed to obey established social conventions and governmental directives. This course develops economic principles from the ground up through successive extensions of a simple intuitive model. We first explore the economizing behavior of a single individual, acting alone, who struggles to survive by employing available resources to produce food and shelter. From this \"Robinson Crusoe\" model we derive basic concepts such as income, wealth, and utility; opportunity cost; labor and wages; capital and interest; land and rent; risk, profit and loss; competition; and, uniting them all, the equimarginal principle of optimization. We then introduce cooperation and exchange among persons in order to analyze markets, prices, property, externalities, public goods, money and credit, and the economic functions of government. Throughout, the human economy is understood as embedded in local and global ecosystems. Thought experiments are supplemented with an historical survey of actual economies, from hunter-gatherer societies to agricultural subsistence economies to contemporary industrial systems.

Why did the Industrial Revolution take place in Britain, and not elsewhere? Why were some countries \"no-shows\", or very slow, to join the development bandwagon? What are the economic motivations, and consequences, of wars? How do institutions and government interventions frame economic growth? How important is international trade for Europe? What opportunities and challenges do natural resources (or lack thereof) pose? How did the European Union and the Eurozone come to be? Can present-day Europe overcome its challenges? The course is designed for inquiring minds who wish to understand how Europe came to be the major economic area it is now. Our approach is interdisciplinary (history, sociology, politics, geography, institutions\u2026); however we will insist on their economic aspect. Class size: 25",

Economic theory helps us to develop behavioral hypotheses, while statistics help us to test these hypotheses. For example, consumer theory tells us that there is an inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded; we use econometrics to see if consumers actually behave in this way. Designed as an advanced continuation of Econ 229 (Introduction to Econometrics), this course provides a rigorous treatment of regression analysis. Topics include models and tests that deal with violations of classical assumptions, time series, panel data, structural models and limited dependent variables.

        "department": "economics",
        "description": "This course couldn't be more timely. Since the 1980s, income inequality has increased dramatically and is now the highest on record. More and more income goes to capital and profits, not workers and labor. Since 2000, 95% of income gains have gone to the top 1% -whose share is at an all-time high. Economists have only recently turned their attention to those facts and there is much uncertainty regarding the causes and consequences of those trends, let alone the potential economic policies required. What explains this shift in the distribution of income? What are the roles of technology, international trade, finance, institutions and governance? Why has growth become so biased towards the very few? Is there a tradeoff between growth and equity? Through what processes is income created and distributed? What are extractive and predatory governments? Is inequality bad and if so, why? Is there such a thing as a balanced, or equitable growth and if so, what does it take? This seminar presents a survey of the landmark theories of economic growth and income distribution and tries to relate those issues. The course is half lecture, half discussion and involves data procurement and analysis. The course is also research-based, through the reading of state-of-the-art journal articles and the writing of a term paper. We focus on the case of the United States and provide international comparisons. Class size: 15",

        "description": "Cross-listed: Economics & Finance The seminar will contrast the academic analysis of financial economics with the coverage it receives in the newspapers and on the nightly newscast. The stories on the news are almost always connected with people, whether we observe them shouting bids in a trading floor or talking on two phones simultaneously. Financial markets are dominated by people behaving in many different ways. Yet traditional finance theories concentrate on efficient markets, predictable prices that are determined by the concepts of present value, rates of return and analysis and pricing of computable risks. Human behavior has neither a place in the theory nor a need to be studied. This prevailing view has recently been challenged by the new paradigm of behavioral finance that considers the many anomalies of \"rational\" behavior and \"efficiency\" of markets. The new paradigm concerns itself with economic decision-making and investor psychology, and specifically with questions relating to how and why people exhibit a mixture of rational and irrational behavior. The seminar will examine the influence of economic psychology in the decision-making process of various agents as well as in the market's dynamics. Several guest lecturers will also offer their informed views in the development of contemporary finance. Class size: 15",

The course traces the complex processes of conquest, empire building, and the creation of many diverse, complex, and dynamic communities, societies, and cultures from the convergence of Native, European, African, and Asian peoples. The course considers peoples in the Spanish and Portuguese Empires of North and South America in three centuries, from the late fifteenth to early nineteenth centuries, starting with the first native settlements and indigenous societies. These empires later transformed into places like California, Texas, and the US Southwest, and nations as diverse as Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico. Using sources like codices, native language writings, and other readings and writings of men and women in Colonial Latin America, the class will reflect on the peoples, places, events, as well as beliefs, cultures, and conflicts of a world different from our own. The course allows for a consideration of the historical legacies of the colonial period in contemporary Latin America. No previous study of Latin American history is required for this course.

Why did Japan\u2019s transformations during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries lead to the total war of the 1930s and 1940s? And why did the horrible destruction experienced after World War II ultimately result in rapid economic growth and renewed global importance for Japan after the 1950s? These questions provide the framework for our study of modern Japanese history. Throughout the course we will focus special attention on Japan\u2019s distinctive urban culture, the changing role of women in Japanese society, the re-invention of Japan\u2019s imperial institution, the domestic and international effects of Japanese imperialism, and the question of the United States\u2019 role in Japan\u2019s post-war reconstruction.

The geographic focus will be the towns, cities, and peasant communes of the Italian and German speaking regions of Europe, particularly the Italian peninsula, Holy Roman Empire, and Switzerland. Two apparently opposed developments will be at the center of our approach: first, the role of the autonomous peasant commune, particularly in Switzerland, as a model and spur for political forms such as democracy and anarchism; second, the development of modern capitalism and technology as they came to impinge on the traditional feudal and communal orders. The course will also address the historiography and politics -surrounding the \"invention\" of the Renaissance in the late nineteenth century, looking particularly at Burckhardt's relation with Ranke, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche.

In a nuclear age, any misstep threatened to be fatal not only to the antagonists but possibly also to the entire human community. What caused this hostile confrontation to emerge from the World War II alliance? How did Soviet-American rivalry affect the international community? And why after more than fifty years did the dance end in peace rather than war? Traditionally historians have approached those questions from a national point of view. Their answers had political as well as academic implications. To blame the Soviet Union was to condemn Communism; to charge the United States was to find capitalism as the root cause of international tensions. In this course we try to reconsider the Cold War by simultaneously weighing both the American and Soviet perspective on events as they unfolded. We will look at Stalinism, McCarthyism, the nuclear arms race, the space race, the extension of the Cold War into the third world, the rise of American hegemony, Vietnam and Afghanistan, Star Wars, and the effort to reach strategic arms limitation agreements. Finally, we will challenge the claims of American conservative ideologues that the Reagan arms buildup \"won the cold war.\" Students will examine key documents of the Cold War era and prepare several papers on world areas or events that they chose to explore.

Using theoretical texts on sound, affect and oral tradition, students will identify different cultures of listening with the aim of unpacking what it means to use words and music in order to \"broadcast\" history. As a final project and in conjunction with the Human Rights Program\u2019s Radio Initiative, students will design a podcast on a topic of historical relevance to the course. Class size: 22",

In parallel, we will examine the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in the wake of World War I. We will progress chronologically from the turn of the twentieth century up to 1923, by which time the Bolsheviks had secured supremacy in most of the regions of the former Tsarist Empire, and Turkey had regrouped under Mustafa Kemal to win its war of independence. We will focus on five major periods in depth: political upheaval in the late Tsarist and Ottoman regimes (1903-1909), the Italian and Balkan wars (1911-1913), the Great War from 1914-1918, the Russian revolutionary upheaval of 1917-1918 and finally the Russian Civil War, which largely coincided (and intersected with) Turkey\u2019s own war of independence. We will conclude with a look at the \"settlement of 1922-23,\" when most diplomatic questions opened up by the collapse of the Romanov and Ottoman empires had been settled by force of arms. Motivated first-year students are encouraged to enroll in this course. Class size: 22",

Furthermore, it considers how this particular early modern legacy shaped the policies of the Ottoman and post-Ottoman states toward legal reform in the modern period (19th-20th centuries). Finally, the course investigates the contemporary politics of law in the contemporary Middle East. Readings and class discussions will revolve around the intersection of law with various social spheres such as religious conversion, gender, slavery, economy and human rights. Class size: 18",

Our point of departure will be traditional areas of focus for scholars of gender and sexuality in China: footbinding, the cloistering of women, and the masculinization of public space; the transformations of Confucian age-sex hierarchies within the family; the women\u2019s rights movements of the early twentieth century; and the Chinese Communist revolution\u2019s ambivalent legacy for women in the People\u2019s Republic of China. By drawing on recent historical and anthropological literature, we will also analyze gender\u2019s functions in many other aspects of modern Chinese life. These topics will include constructions of masculinity and male identity during China\u2019s late imperial period (1368-1911), the role of gender categories in constructions of Han Chinese relations with both Inner Asian nomadic peoples and Euro-American imperialists, the gendering of citizenship and comradeship in twentieth century China, the impact of global capitalism on gender constructions and sexual relations in contemporary China, and the relation of China\u2019s women\u2019s movement to recent trends in Euro-American feminism and gender studies.

Is there something essential that links capitalism, even liberal democratic capitalism, to slavery? How have struggles against slavery and for freedom and rights, dealt with this connection? This course will investigate the development of this linkage, studying areas like the gender dynamics of early modern Atlantic slavery, the correlation between coercive political and economic authority, and the financial implications of abolition and emancipation. We will focus on North America and the Caribbean from the early 17th century articulation of slavery through the staggered emancipations of the 19th century. The campaign against the slave trade has been called the first international human rights movement \u2013 today does human rights discourse simply provide a human face for globalized capitalism, or offer an alternative vision to it? Questions of contemporary reparations, rising colonialism and markets of the nineteenth century, and the 'duty' of the Americas to Africa will also be considered. Readings will include foundational texts on capitalism and a variety of historical approaches to the problem of capitalism within slavery, from economic, cultural, and intellectual perspectives.

Why did so few stand against slavery? Is it possible to ever adequately represent the Holocaust? This introduction to the field of public history will look at the role that historians and other academics play in shaping the institutions and practice of public history and the relationship(s) among public history, American culture, and popular memory. It will also address the practical aspects of career opportunities and internships in this field such as curatorship, documentary film, archival work, historic preservation, and community building.

For some, it meant moral and spiritual rejuvenation. For most, it meant an opportunity to tap a natural warehouse of resources that could be turned into wealth. At no time have those two visions been compatible, despite the efforts of politicians, artists, and scientists to reconcile them. This course is about that struggle. It looks specifically at the United States from the colonial era until the early Twentieth Century--a period in which one of the world\u2019s most abundant wildernesses was largely transformed into an urbanized, industrial landscape. We will study the costs and consequences of that transformation while listening to the voices of those who proposed alternative visions.",

Through a mix of theoretical and historical texts, we will consider how print media have fostered the development of new political communities like the nation state, generated publics and counter-publics, both created and undermined cultural authority, enabled new dynamics of knowledge production, and facilitated development of new modes of reading and interiority. Our inquiry will be global in scope, encompassing not only the Gutenberg revolution in Europe but also the diverse forms of print culture and print capitalism that developed contemporaneously in the Middle East, South Asia, and East Asia. Analysis of the recent rise of digital media will provide critical perspective for understanding how the materiality of the printed text and its circulation through space has affected its social, cultural, and political significance. Ten weeks of the course will be dedicated to shared readings and discussion.

Historians are perplexed because Africa\u2019s independence and decolonization were supposed to bring peace and prosperity, and henceforth scholarship reflected this desire and promise. This seminar challenges students to move beyond the rhetoric of political conflict in Africa that extends from realities of failed states and underdevelopment and instead understand these current struggles as crises of historiography. In short, what does a contemporary history of Africa look like with the concept of civil war? Course participants will seek to understand the ongoing conflict in Central African Republic and South Sudan within a larger historical context of civil war in post-independent Africa. Through shared readings and discussions, students will use primary and secondary sources to consider possible causes for civil unrest in Nigeria, Angola, Mozambique, and Sierra Leone, the actors and interests involved, proposed resolutions, and their immediate and long-term effects. By tracing a historiography of civil war in African historical and political discourse and by analyzing possible methodological complications, students will grapple with how real world experiences and acts of violence translate into historical narratives, the very politics of historical revisionism. Students will be required to develop and carry out an independent research project of their choosing.",

After brief consideration of the origins of history as a formal academic discipline (separate from literature) in the 19th Century, and of the transition from political to social history in the mid-twentieth century, we also consider the shift from social history to the multiplicity of approaches that came out of the \"theory explosion\" between the 1960s and 1990s. This course draws from the fields of modern European, African and World History. The larger questions to keep in mind throughout the course are: What are the interpretive strategies used and debated by historians? What type of evidence does the author use? How does a historian work with both evidence and interpretive frameworks to produce historical writing?To get at some of these questions, the course draws largely (but not entirely) from historical writing about the Great War from a variety of historiographical points of view. Secondary School teaching of WWI tends to come from the diplomatic history approach, and to emphasize the war on the western front. To enlarge this view, we will read not only about the classic \"causes of WWI\" literature, but also from gender, cultural, and post-colonial treatments of the war. Working with this diversity of texts gives us opportunity explicitly to discuss how different historiographical approaches change how we understand \"what happened.\" Class size: 5",

        "description": "Cross-listed: Art History, German Studies This course will examine major contributions to philosophical aesthetics, beginning from Kant\u2019s Critique of Judgment, an account of critical judgment that transformed eighteenth-century debates about beauty, taste, and art and continues to inform accounts of criticism and the arts to the present day. Particular attention will be given to philosophical discussions of the standard of beauty, progress in the arts, the medium of an art, art\u2019s relationship to truth, art and the theatrical, and the antagonism of art and convention; throughout, these discussions will be brought to a consideration of the accomplishment of individual works of art. The goal of the course is to develop a critical understanding of works that have shaped our conceptions of the distinct nature and history of the individual arts, of modern art, of the task of criticism, and of the relation of the arts to culture and society. Readings will include essays and selections from longer works by David Hume, Immanuel Kant, G.W.F. Hegel, Martin Heidegger, Walter Benjamin, Clement Greenberg, Michael Fried, and Stanley Cavell, among others. Course assignments will include several short essays and a final paper. Class size: 22",

While these questions can arise in mundane contexts and have little import, they can also arise in morally fraught contexts and have tremendous import. So arriving at the right answers is important. Practical reasoning is the process of reflecting upon and resolving the question of what to do. We will examine different philosophical views on what makes answers to such questions correct, focusing on those in the traditions of Aristotle, Hume, and Kant.",

We will also screen a number of films and videos, including the Anita Hill/Clarence Thomas hearings, Madonna's \"Truth or Dare,\" and documentaries on the pre-Stonewall femme-butch bar-scene culture of the 1950s and 60s, anorexia, rape on campus, the pornographic film industry, and several others.

In this course we too will \"raise anew\" the question of being by engaging in a sustained close reading of Heidegger'sBeing and Time. Through our reading, we will grapple withHeidegger's phenomenological approach and attempt to work through central Heideggerian themes and concepts such as Dasein, Being-in-the-World, Being-with, Care, Thrownness, Anxiety, Temporality, Being-towards-Death, Resoluteness, and Authenticity.

The course will review the ideas of a few major thinkers such as Adam Smith, Karl Marx, Karl Polanyi, Thorstein Veblen, John Maynard Keynes, and John Kenneth Galbraith, and will introduce students to two subfields in particular: international political economy and the political economy of development. Among the questions we would ask are: Why are some countries rich and others poor? What is development? What are the prime movers of globalization? Is the US an empire given its influence and power in the global economy? How can development be redefined to tackle the challenge of climate change? Among issues that we will look at closely is the role of organizations such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the World Trade Organization in managing the global economy and the current debates about reforming these institutions.

Indigent defendants are falsely convicted, and even executed for crimes they did not commit. We say that law is the institutional embodiment of justice. And yet, it is equally true that law, as it is practiced, seems to have little connection to justice. As the novelist William Gaddis writes: \"Justice? You get justice in the next world. In this world, you have the law.\" This course explores the apparent disconnect between law and justice. Can contemporary legal systems offer justice? Can we, today, still speak of a duty to obey the law? Is it possible for law to do justice? Through readings of legal cases as well as political, literary, and philosophical texts, we seek to understand the problem of administering justice as it emerges in the context of contemporary legal institutions.

        "department": "politicalstudies",
        "description": "Cross-listed: Experimental Humanities (1 credit) In the last year, popular books like The Unwinding by George Packer and Coming Apart by Charles Murray have bemoaned the fading of the American Ideal. On the left, The Unwinding tells the tale of the demise of American institutions and the loss of American ideals as an inspiring dream. On the right, Coming Apart gives voice to the sense that America no longer exists as a single nation; Murray argues that Americans in wealthy zip codes have pitifully little in common with their countrymen in poor zip codes. These differences include not simply lifestyle, but also values and dreams. If Murray thinks Americans are increasingly living in fundamentally different worlds, Packer sees the once great American dream crumbling around us, consumed by corruption, consumption, and institutional failure. We confront today the weakening of our collective vision of freedom and equality. Occupy Wall Street and the Tea Party manifest anger at the betrayal of American constitutional democracy, but with little awareness of a common heritage. Americans are dismayed at the power of money, the decay of self-governance, and a bureaucracy that seems impervious to popular control. And yet few dare to articulate a collective vision that might hold the country together. The 2014 Hannah Arendt Center Conference will ask: Are there common ideals left that we share as Americans? How can racial justice co-exist with American ideals? How can we save and reinvigorate American Dream? Can Americans build myths and institutions that nurture a common world? This 1 unit class will meet 5 times. At four meetings prior to the Arendt Center Conference on Oct. 9-10 we will read material by speakers at the conference, such as excerpts from Roberto Mangabeira Unger, Lawrence Lessig, Kendall Thomas, George Packer, Charles Murray, Joan Richardson, and Hannah Arendt. We will discuss as well John Ford\u2019s film \"The Searchers\" and George Cukor\u2019s \"Philadelphia Story.\" Students will attend the conference and have the opportunity to respond by creating humanistic essays in the medium of their choice. These may include blog posts, videos, digital maps, or other forms. There will be one post-conference meeting to discuss the conference and students will be able to present their work at the Experimental Humanities Share Event at the end of the semester.

This course unpacks the historical and ideological roots of that conflict, how it has developed over the course of the years, and what possibilities exist for its resolution in the future. The course is divided into three main sections. The first one covers the years between the Spanish-American War of 1898 and the events leading to World War II. It emphasizes U.S. attempts at creating a \"sphere of influence\" over Latin America, highlighted by numerous military interventions in places like Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean, as well as Latin American responses to what they perceived to be an American project of imperialism. The second section focuses on the dynamics of the Cold War as played out throughout Latin America. It emphasizes the real and perceived fears by U.S. policy-makers about the advent of Marxist-inspired revolutions in Latin America, which led to interventions in Cuba, Chile, and Guatemala, among other nations, and the high toll that the Cold War exacted upon the peoples of Latin America. The third and final section looks at the most salient issues in contemporary U.S-L.A. relations: economic integration, the illicit drug trade, and Latin American migration to the United States.

But the difficulties with the idealized model of the nation-state are quite apparent for all to see. For instance, various forms of ethno-national mobilization--based on solidarities both larger and smaller than the nation-state\u2014have challenged official state nationalisms. The twenty first century opened with talk of moving beyond the nation-state. But at that time in certain parts of the world multi-national political spaces were getting reorganized along national lines. This was also when failing and collapsed states became top foreign policy concerns of major powers, and a new form of international regimes of intervention came into being. The course will examine the idea of the nation -- its historical and contemporary competitors -- the emergence of the nation-state system, and the challenges confronting this system. Our approach will be comparative and we will draw on the experiences of all world regions. Interested students should email Prof. Baruah prior to registration (baruah@bard.edu) with a short statement of why they would like to take this class. Class size: 20",

While most characterizations of democracy see it as a form of government, this course explores the essence of democracy as a specifically modern way of life. To do so, it turns to some great thinkers of American democracy such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, Walt Whitman, Ralph Ellison, W. E. B. DuBois, and Hannah Arendt. What unites these radical democrats is the conviction that democracy is a practice of individuals rather than an institutional form of governance. As an ideal of radical individualism, American democratic thought offers, perhaps surprisingly, an aristocratic critique of the limits of democratic government even as it, seen from another side, makes possible our culture of narcissistic consumerism. Our aim is to understand the democratic spirit of radical individualism that has proven so seductive and powerful since its modern birth in the American revolution. Texts will include Emerson\u2019s essays The American Scholar and Experience, Thoreau\u2019s Walden, Ellison\u2019s Invisible Man and Arendt\u2019s On Revolution. Class size: 15",

We begin by examining the assumptions we bring to the study of Buddhism as a \"religion\" and the circumstances of the initial Western encounter with Buddhist traditions. We then look at the Indian origins of Buddhism and its relationship to other Indian religious and philosophical traditions. In particular, we consider how Buddhism evolved in relation to other major developments in Indian culture such as the invention of writing and the rise of images as a form of religious expression. Next, we explore representations of the Buddha\u2019s birth and enlightenment in the art and texts of the early tradition. As we proceed to look at key aspects of the tradition, thinking about how Buddhism challenges existing ideals of self and identity will feature prominently in our discussions. While much of the course focuses upon the rise of Buddhism as an Indian religion, we will also consider how the tradition was reinvented in its spread to Southeast and East Asia and the Himalayas.

        "department": "socstudies",
        "description": "Cross-listed: Human Rights It has now been more than fifty years since the original work of Stanley Milgram at Yale University demonstrated the remarkable and widely unpredicted finding that large numbers of individuals in multiple samples of American men and women studied were willing to \"punish\" another person when ordered to do so by an experimenter; this in the context of a psychology experiment on learning and memory. The prominence of the initial work and the continued salience of such study, including the pronounced ethical considerations and the necessary generalizability to societal and historical contexts cannot be over-stated. As recently as five years ago a replication of the original study with only slight modifications was published (J. Burger, January 2009) and more recent studies reveals that \"obedience\" is very much prevalent in our society and in many others as well. Also the ethical debate and ecological validity controversy have not lessened. But aside from the volume of investigations the current domain of the \"Milgram study\" is especially worthy of continuing interest; this because of historical events in the intervening years since1960. The seminar will convey that the continuing study of obedience phenomena is vital for the betterment of institutions - even in a democratic society - and that social scientists must find a way to safely and ethically investigate the conditions that promote destructive obedience and learn the rudiments of how it can be minimized. This is an upper college seminar. It is designed for moderated social studies majors and even those from other divisions of the college, who will require permission of the instructor to enroll. Criteria for membership are a willingness to read with care and then with conviction share the results of such reading and study. (The title for this seminar is taken from the biography of Stanley Milgram authored by Thomas Blass, a professor of social psychology at the University of Maryland Baltimore County campus.

        "description": "Cross-listed: American Studies, Gender & Sexuality Studies, Human Rights Why do some people have more wealth, more power, and receive greater respect than others? What are the sources of this inequality? Is social inequality inevitable? Is it undesirable? Through lectures, documentary films and discussions, this course examines the ways by which socially-defined categories of persons (e.g., women and men, Blacks and Whites, rich and poor, native- and foreign-born) are unevenly rewarded for their social contributions. Sociological theories are used to explain how and why social inequality is produced and maintained, and how it affects the well being of individuals and social groups. The course will focus on two general themes. The first deals with the structure of inequality while studying the unequal distribution of material and social resources (e.g., prestige, income, occupation). The second examines the processes that determine the allocation of people to positions in the stratification system (e.g. education, intelligence, parental wealth, gender, race). Class size: 22",

The course is organized according to different institutional and interactional contexts, including families, workplaces, schools, the state & politics, sexuality, culture, and identity.Our discussions will be guided by both theoretical approaches to gender and a variety of empirical research. A second goal of this course is to become familiar with various sociological theories of gender difference and inequality. A third goal is to learn how gender inequality is intertwined with other axes of power such as race/ethnicity, class, and sexuality and how to conduct such \"intersectional\" analysis of social life. In addition, students will learn to identify and evaluate various forms of sociological evidence and arguments. Class size: 22",

Thus, the study of social and political dynamics in urban centers is crucial if we are to understand and address the pressing issues of the contemporary world. This course will allow students to explore these dynamics through an introduction to urban sociology: the study of social relations, processes, and changes in the urban context. We will begin by reading perspectives on the development of cities, followed by an examination of how the city and its socio-spatial configuration affect and are affected by social interactions, particularly across gender, race, and class lines. The course will then consider the relationship between globalization and the modern city before concluding with a few examples of how citizens address the challenges in their communities. Throughout, we will explore the diverse methods that social scientists use to understand these dynamics, and students will have the opportunity to utilize some of these methods in an investigation of a local \"urban community.\" Class size: 22",

The course will be concerned with the theory and rationale upon which social research is based, as well as the practical aspects of research and the problems the researcher is likely to encounter. The course is divided into two parts. In the first, we will learn how to formulate research questions and hypotheses, how to choose the appropriate research method for the problem, and how to maximize chances for valid and reliable findings. In the second part, we will learn how to perform simple data analysis and how to interpret and present findings in a written report. For a final paper, students use data from the U.S. General Social Survey (GSS) to study public attitudes toward issues such as abortion, immigration, inequality and welfare, affirmative action, gender roles, religion, the media, and gun laws. By the end of the semester, students will have the necessary skills for designing and conducting independent research for term papers and senior projects, as well as for non-academic enterprises.

The first part of the class introduces the concepts used by classical sociological theories to help us understand society and consider how sports function in society. We will also study some mainstream sociological theorists that have studied sports in detail. We will then move on to consider inequalities portrayed and reproduced in sport, related to gender, race and class. Other substantive research areas in the sociology of sport include roles of fans and athletes, politics of sport, nationalism and competition, globalization, media, and sport and the body.

As to the recent past, consider: first blacks gains since the Civil Rights era (political, economic, social \u2013 however incomplete); second, Hispanics and Asians transforming what it means to be non-white; and third, the virtual disappearance of earlier rigid divisions among Euro-American ethnics such as Irish, Italians, Jews and Slavs. We will explore the meaning of contemporary race, ethnicity and assimilation with these recent American patterns in mind. We will also spend a substantial part of the course on the growing efforts by thoughtful Americans, mostly social scientists, to think about the directions that these patterns of group life may take in the coming few decades. Topics include: social mobility and economic wellbeing, interracial marriage, political power, discrimination, the impact of immigration, group identity and culture, the expected racial transformation to a non-white American majority.

What role does technology play in our lives? Technology changes what we do - does it change who we are? We are living at a time of rapid technological innovation and diffusion and the above questions indicate that these new technologies are the cause of both much excitement and much concern. In this class students will learn to understand a variety of media technologies in their historical context and they will explore the impact that these technologies have had on social and political life. To this end, we need to think about technologies in a couple of different ways: (1) What does technology (print, radio, Twitter\u2026) enable us to do? (2) How does technology affect the way people think about themselves, their political situation and the social world? And what are the consequences of these changes? Students will become familiar with relevant concepts from political sociology including nationalism, the public sphere, social capital and social movements. We will also consider the downside of media technologies, and inequalities in terms of access and participation. Class size: 22",

Yet often lost in these debates\u2014in which positions are typically polarized between those who view globalization as a positive, inevitable force, and others who view it as destructive\u2014are a number of important intellectual and practical issues around which this course is organized. We will examine what is and is not unique about the contemporary era, and address how new forms of production and networking are transforming the role of the nation-state, affecting wealth distribution, and impacting the natural environment. This course will also look closely at how modern-day globalization has given rise to new forms of social conflict, political contestation, and struggles for change. Through projects conducted in the Hudson Valley and interdisciplinary academic study, this course will challenge students to think holistically about transnational processes and consider the fundamental question of what it means to be a citizen in this globalized world.

Students will be introduced to the emerging discipline of Performance Studies which combines insights from the study of the theater and performing arts with sociological and anthropological work on ritual and community. We will examine how sociologists have used performance as an analytical model, from the work of Erving Goffman on the presentation of self in everyday life to Alexander\u2019s model of social performance. The seminar will be discussion and exercise based, with some films and lectures. Substantive topics that we will study using a performance lens include the performance of reconciliation in post-Apartheid South Africa, the mobilization of mothers in Argentina\u2019s \u2018Dirty War\u2019, gender as a socially constructed performance, the use of performance in social movements, and the performance of political campaigns.

It engages questions about power relations; the construction of knowledge; subjectivity; and debates over agency and individualism. The class straddles political and cultural sociology and links the micro-level of everyday experience with macro-level questions of power and politics. It covers the symbolic interactionist tradition, including Mead and Goffman, and how sociology broke with Enlightenment ideas about the individual. We delve into qualitative and historical research on many contexts, including paid labor, the field of psychology, prisons, self-help groups, and reproductive policy. We also consider how social relations become embodied in us as ways of being in the world. The course looks closely at the \"governmentality\" scholarship associated with Foucault that examines how authorities think about and enact forms of regulation and control. The course will enable students to examine questions of identity and individuality, recent shifts toward \"neoliberal\" governance, and the politics of empowerment. Class size: 15",
