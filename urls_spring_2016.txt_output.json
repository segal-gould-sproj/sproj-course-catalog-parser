        "description": "Cross-listed: Science, Technology &Society The discovery of photography was announced in 1839, almost simultaneously by several inventors. Born of experiments in art and science, the medium combines vision and technology. It possesses a uniquely intimate relation to the real and for this reason has many applications outside the realm of fine art; nevertheless, from its inception photography has been a vehicle for artistic aspirations. This survey of the history of photography from its earliest manifestations to the 2000s considers the medium's applications - as art, science, historical record, and document. This course is open to all students and is the prerequisite for most other courses in the history of photography. Class size: 25",

Self-reliance and discipline were the primary means to achieve release from suffering. Within five hundred years the philosophy, responding to external forces, evolved into a religion incorporating new ideologies of eschatology of the Buddha of the Future and of paradisiacal cults. A new pantheon of deities appeared with the powers to aid mankind in its search for immortality. Buddhist pictorial art begins with auspicious emblems representing key ideas of the doctrine and anthropomorphic images of the Buddha; later, the new pantheon is formulated and employed in the art. This course analyzes the development of Buddhist art in India from its earliest depictions and its transmission through Southeast Asia, Central Asia, to China and Japan. Class size: 25",

Wharton situates her characters\u2019 public or private lives and their social or moral decisions within a carefully constructed architectural framework. In her short stories and novels, architecture not only sets the stage and mood, but also emerges as a character, chorus, or choreographer, contributing to, commenting on, or controlling the action (or inaction).

Advances in geographic surveying, the development of photography, the emergence of geography as a discipline, and even the term \"cartography\" are all products of the nineteenth century and carried significant weight in the practice of mapping cities during that time. This class will look at mapsproduced in selected cities of North and South America, Europe, Africa, and South Asia, exploring the impact of industrial expansion, colonial ambitions, frontier enterprises, and technological developments in transportation and telecommunication. Readings span a range of disciplines to encompass the experience of the nineteenth-century city as well as a theoretical perspective of the act of mapping the metropole versus the colonial city, including texts by Walter Benjamin, Charles Dickens, Theodore Dreiser, Rudyard Kipling, David Harvey, Henri Lefebvre, William Cronon, and Benedict Anderson.

Developed in the fourteenth century as a painted or carved image program placed on an altar table, the altarpiece became a site for artistic innovation. Focusing on medieval and Renaissance examples from across Western  Europe, this course explores the development, function, iconography, and art historical and liturgical significance of important altarpieces.

Specifically, we will focus on the ways in which the human-animal boundary is tested, explored, or delimited in zoos and menageries, scientific illustration, taxidermy, physiognomic studies, hunting and hunting scenes, still life paintings, depictions of fables, myths, and history in which animals play a central role, elaborate banquets featuring animals, and representations of domesticated pets and livestock.

Along the way, we will discuss topics such as: photography\u2019s status as \"the bastard child of art and science,\" \"passing\" (i.e., how to make photographs that look like art) photography and art pedagogy, pornography, the fine art nude, and Victorian mores, photography\u2019s role in the \"liberation\" of painting, and the 20th century repudiation of the 19th century photography\u2019s art aspirations.

Sought out by musicians, performing artists and others who seek clarity and efficiency in motion and expression, Alexander Technique aims to identify habitual misuse, promoting ease in any physical practice. Students will be asked to identify habits of personal use and alignment through observation, study of the skeleton, drawing, movement and touch. Readings, including articles by F.M. Alexander, John Dewey, Raymond Dart and other more recent practitioners, writing assignments & discussion will extend this study.

From there, our scope will expand to consider these artists\u2019 trends alongside modernism and postmodernism\u2019s philosophical developments, modern and postmodern characteristics of other art forms, and significant political and cultural developments influencing the modern/postmodern distinction. We will delve into these topics through video, class discussion, focused weekly readings, reflective analysis assignments, and embodied explorations.

The one-year sequence, conducted as a lecture course, is designed to give the student a broad introduction to the history and aesthetics of film from a roughly chronological perspective. There are weekly screenings of major films widely acknowledged as central to the evolution of the medium as well as supplementary reading assignments which provide both a narrative history and a strong encounter with the leading critical and theoretical issues of cinema, often within a context of 20th century art and literature. While the student can take either half of the sequence, the program recommends that both parts of the course are taken, especially for any student contemplating film as a concentration. Mid-term and final exams; term paper. The second half of the sequence begins with crucial films in the transition to the technology and aesthetic of the sound film on an international scale, those by Lang, Sternberg, Bunuel, Vertov and Vigo. There follows a study of the evolution of the long-take, deep-focus aesthetic in the films of Renoir, Welles and Mizoguchi; of Hollywood genres in the films of Ford, Hitchcock, Hawks and Sturges; the rise of neo-realism in Rossellini, DeSica and Visconti; the contribution of the American avant-garde in Deren, Peterson, Brakhage, Anger, Smith, Conner and Breer; the French New Wave in Godard, Truffaut and Rohmer; the northern tradition in Dreyer and Bergman; selections of Asian filmic practice in films of Ray, Kurosawa, and Ozu; and finally, further European innovations in Antonioni, Varda, the Taviani Bros., Pasolini, et al.

How can artists interested in creating critical and self-reflexive media respond to video\u2019s immediacy and \"liveness\"?

Course participants will work on individual projects using cameras, monitors, switchers, surveillance systems, projectors, and software-based video mixers. The first half of the course concentrates on the creation of performance \"tapes\" (or tape-less video documents) and the history of experimental video focused on framing staged live activities.

Subjects we will explore include legal definitions, as applied in war crime trials, the political use made of historical atrocities, and the way the Nuremberg and Tokyo tribunals changed the way we look at war crimes. The question of genocide will be a recurrent theme. The course will be taught from a culturally comparative perspective. Japanese, German, and French films will be screened as well as American ones. The Japanese war in Asia will be considered, as well as Nazi crimes in Europe, the Vietnam War and the French colonial wars. Films will range from Judgment at Nuremberg to Battle of Algiers. The infamous Nanking Massacre of 1937, will be looked at from Japanese as well as various Chinese points of view. Along with viewing the films, we will read various books, including Christopher Browning's Ordinary Men, Paul Aussaresses's The Battle of the Casbah, and Seymour Hersh's My Lai 4. Class size: 12",

        "department": "film",
        "description": "A survey devoted to the major theories of film from the so-called \"classical period\" (largely the first half of the twentieth century), when both critics and writer/filmmakers were manifestly trying to establish a groundwork for how to think of the relatively new medium of cinema as an expressive form worthy by itself of serious consideration among its more established sister arts. Class discussions will primarily evolve from close readings of sometimes highly complex aesthetic arguments that think through the properties of the medium. We will scrutinize the answers to various questions such as: Can what is deemed \"cinematic\" ever be isolated from other art forms? Can film be thought of as constituting a language? Select film screenings will support our understanding of the written texts. A number of readings will offer a more general philosophical questioning of the nature of art itself, since cinema seems to invite speculation that technology and modern consciousness may have brought dramatically new pressures to bear on aesthetic thinking. Writers to be discussed include C. S. Peirce, Benedetto Croce, Ferdinand de Saussure, Hugo Munsterberg, Erwin Panofsky, Sergei Eisenstein, Rudolf Arnheim, Siefried Kracauer, Maya Deren, Stan Brakhage, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Hollis Frampton, Andrei Tarkovsky, Laura Mulvey, Walter Benjamin, Andre Bazin, Susan Sontag, Gilles Deleuze, Umberto Eco, Christian Metz, et al.

Taking examples from China, Cuba, Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, this course surveys the cultural policies of socialist states and their effects on the lives, listening habits, and creative output of musicians and music consumers. From the politics of Azeri opera, to the subversive sounds of Siberian punk, to the performance of masculinity in Chinese and Cuban pop music, we will investigate how political ideologies generated state support for certain kinds of music while suppressing other forms of unofficial, underground and protest music. Students will develop an understanding of how socialist cultural policy models in diverse regions of the world have understood the uses and the threats posed by musical culture in daily and symbolic life. Furthermore, we will evaluate what happens when the ideological imperatives of a regime transform, fade away, or are suddenly replaced with a new political ideology. Readings include historical, anthropological, and musicological texts that examine the relationship of musical sound to publics, counterpublics and states. Students will produce written works responding to class readings and themes, and develop final projects according to their own research interests. Students do not need to read musical notation to take this class.

We will examine all the manuscripts of the Concord in order to learn as much as we can about Ives\u2019s compositional process.

Particular emphasis is placed on the mythological origins and literary inspirations for these musical works. Each week, students will synthesize diverse materials and contribute to class discussions by offering analyses and opinions on reading and listening assignments. A final project consists of a well-researched paper and class presentation, which gives each student an opportunity to explore other \"wild\" Baroque compositions or composers not addressed in weekly lectures or discussions.

Soundscape, a central, contested concept in sound studies, will constitute the primary field of interrogation. Our class will bring forth these debates in order to reveal the nuances involved in a sonic ethnography of urban spaces. This course will engage remote campuses through Bard\u2019s Network. Each participating campus will appoint one resident faculty member to collaborate in the preparation of the syllabus and the weekly exercises. Following the syllabus and the assigned weekly readings, students will work asynchronously to develop projects that will be shared online, such as sound walks, mixtapes, sound collages, etc. In the first iteration of this class, students will be exchanging their geographies of sounds with students from Al-Quds (Palestine).

The issues discussed in Painting I, mainly the language of color, value, temperature, contrast, saturation, intensity, etc. and strong structural relationships, will serve as building blocks for complex figurative compositions. We will be also working from reproductions as we study some of the great figurative masters. Students will be expected to be on time and have the proper equipment. This includes a good assortment of brushes, a proper palette and the required colors. Students will be working on gessoed paper over the first weeks but should know how to stretch and prime a canvas properly. Some of the poses will extend over two weeks, which will allow students to begin to push their work into new places. This class is for students who want to work hard and extend themselves. Students should have experience in drawing and must have had Painting I, there will be no exceptions. Class size: 14",

Students will work with found and self-produced images that have been manipulated using Photoshop, and then incorporate them into larger works on paper or other 2-D surfaces. Assignments will include digital image manipulation, experimentation with printing on various materials, experimentation with alternative drawing materials and processes, exploring the concept of the multiple, and ultimately developing a body of work that reflects relationships between digital and analog drawing processes. This class will take place in the Fisher computer lab and in the Barn. Students should have some working knowledge of Photoshop and have completed Drawing I one other Studio Arts class.

This interdisciplinary course, covering performance and power of the early modern period, will disrupt habitual assumptions about both the disciplines of theater and history. Students will read baroque plays, study their historical contexts, and experiment with staging scenes, to uncover the links between imagined and actual Atlantic expansion and the impact of colonialism, 1492-1825. Artistic forms to be examined include the English court masque, the Spanish auto sacramental, and spectacles of power and conversion staged in the colonial Americas; plays will range from Shakespeare's The Tempest to Marivaux's The Island of Slaves to allegorical works by Calderon, Lope de Vega, Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz, and more.

We will begin with an investigation into the roots of feminist theater, and then explore contemporary practices through the lens of gender and performance theories. We will then investigate how contemporary women in theater and performance are changing, adapting and re-imagining definitions of both gender and performance through their work. Students will research contemporary writers and performers and engage with these works both creatively and critically, through presentations and papers. Students will also prepare scenes from selected plays and explore the theatrical techniques suggested by the writers. Discussions will address how theatrical and performance traditions initiated by women find expression in feminist performance practices today. Writers and performers whose works we will investigate include Virginia Woolf, Gertrude Stein, Adrienne Kennedy, Maria Irene Fornes, Suzan-Lori Parks, Caryl Churchill and Sarah Kane. Performer/writers will include Lisa Kron, Karen Finley, Ann Liv Young and Marina Abramovic, among others. Class size: 15",

The semester begins with stretch and placement techniques and core work to develop a neutral and ready body, followed by a sequence of impulse-based improvisation techniques enabling students to find authentic movement and push past their physical limitations. These improvisations will lead into original phrase work, training students to develop their own unique choreographic and performance styles. The second half of the semester is focused on writing composition.Students will complete timed writing exercises in class, designed to free the creative voice, and will then be given individual guidance and dramaturgical assignments, leading to the development and performance of an original text and movement score.

They will explore the journeys of two 19th century journalists who raced around the world at the same time in opposite directions competing to finish first, and by this act, changed the face of journalism in the U.S. Students will write several short plays following either Nellie Bly\u2019s route (eastward starting by steamboat) or Elizabeth Bishland\u2019s route (westward starting by railway), and may set each scene in any time period between 1889 and the present. Through this project, students will encounter how world cultures were presented in the U.S. by the most popular media of the time--newspapers--and how this exciting and unique contest influenced later generations of writers. By choosing time periods according to cultural and sociopolitical interests in different continents, countries, and cities, students will experience imaginary travels through time. Potential settings include Folkestone, England; Boulogne, France; Brindisi, Italy; Port Said, Egypt; Aden (modern day Yemen); Penang (modern day Malaysia); Yokohama, Japan; Singapore and more. The source material will be drawn from 19th century journalistic writing, histories, and biographies. Final project will be completing an around-the-world-journey-play that is each student\u2019s own unique version. Prerequisite: One creative writing class in any genre.

We will begin with Homer\u2019s Iliad and Odyssey, focusing particularly on the understanding of poetry manifest within the world of these poems. Readings from Greek literature will also include lyric poetry (focusing on Sappho and Pindar), and Attic drama (e.g., Aristophane\u2019s Frogs and Clouds, Aeschylus\u2019 Prometheus Bound, Euripides\u2019 Medea and Bacchae). Readings from the Latin corpus will include epic, lyric, and dramatic poetry (e.g. Vergil, Horace, Catullus, Seneca). Concurrently, we will be examining the ongoing critique of literature from the fragments of early Greek philosophers (e.g. Anaxagoras, Xenophanes, Heraclitus), through Plato and Aristotle, to Cicero and Horace. Our twofold aim will be to develop an understanding of all these texts in their original context and to consider how they set the stage for subsequent developments in western literature and criticism.

The seventeenth century's characteristic figure is Satan struggling against God in Milton's Paradise Lost, but other poets and dramatists like John Donne, Ben Jonson, John Webster, and Andrew Marvell helped to shape the age's passionate interest in the conflict of political, religious, and social ideas and values. After the Civil War and the Puritan rule, monarchy was restored, at least as a reassuring symbol, and writers were free to play up the differences as they did in the witty, bawdy dramatic comedies of the elites and the novels by writers such as Defoe and Fielding which appealed to middle-class readers.

We will look at the majestic, triumphant imaginative liberation in writers such as Isaac Babel, Vladimir Mayakovsky, Osip Mandelstam and Mikhail Bulgakov; the struggle with ideology and the Terror of the 1930s in Yuri Olesha, Anna Akhmatova, Lidia Chukovskaya, Mikhail Zoshchenko, Varlam Shalamov, Boris Pilnyak and Yuri Tynyanov; the hesitant Thaw as reflected in Boris Pasternak\u2019s Dr. Zhivago; and the course will conclude by reading Alexander Solzhenitsyn\u2019s One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich and Moscow to the End of the Line, by Venedikt Erofeev. Readings of literary works will be supplemented with political and historical documents to provide a sense of the larger political-social-historical context in which they were written. After the violent, imaginative ebullience of the Revolutionary period, how did literature stay alive during the darkest period of mass repression, censorship and terror when millions of Soviet citizens were either imprisoned or shot? What formal/aesthetic choices did these writers make in negotiating the demands of official ideology and Party discipline, on the one hand, and authentic literary expression, on the other? What image of history and of man did these \"Engineers of human souls\" produce? These are some of the questions we will ask and seek to answer. All readings will be in English.

This course will draw upon a series of thematic case studies, beginning with European colonialism in the late 19th century to today\u2019s contemporary globalized context that illustrate how cultural production can be read as a form of documentation, resistance, and potential intervention to a range of prevailing narratives. Topics covered include tradition and modernity, the rise (and fall) of nationalism, narrating war, the role of the state, and the performance gender. Interdisciplinary in its approach, this course will ask students to apply the historical and theoretical frameworks provided through the lectures and readings, to a close examination of a range of texts including novels (Sonallah Ibrahim, Assia Djebar), films (Jackie Salloum, Tahani Rached), music (Oum Kalthoum, Dam, Sami Yusuf), and blogs (Riverbend, Hometown Baghdad) from across the region including Egypt, Lebanon, Iraq, Palestine/Israel, Algeria, Iran and Turkey.

A date is the temporal center around which a singular work crystallizes. The constellation of dates this course creates will also reflect on pivotal (German) traditions of conceiving history itself (Nietzsche, Benjamin). Readings further include Kant's What is Enlightenment?, Goethe's Faust, B\u00fcchner's Danton\u2019s Death, Rosa Luxemburg's writing on revolution, as well as Hungerangel by the German Nobel Prize winner Herta M\u00fcller.

The first half of the semester will be devoted to the Classical epic: Iliad, Odyssey, Theogony, Argonautika, De Rerum Natura, Aeneid, Metamorphoses. The second half will trace the epic across the map of Europe: Beowulf (8th-10th c. CE), the Chanson de Roland (11th c.), the Niebelungenlied (13th c), the Divine Comedy (14th c) Orlando Furioso (16th c.), and Milton. Special attention will be paid to the long tradition of European epic as a vehicle for exploring tensions between European and non-European cultures. Most texts will be read in their entirety.

In what ways does the idea of 'nationality' (or 'ethnicity,' or 'community') connect the literary, juridical, and political realms? What does artistic discourse have to do with political ethics? What might a post-national literature involve? Students will read artistic work by (inter alia) Jonathan Swift, Maria Edgeworth, J.M. Synge, W.B.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Classical Studies; Experimental Humanities This course examines the invention of a phenomenon central to modern literary life: the poetry book. First adopted in the ancient Greek-speaking world and further developed among poets at Rome, the book and its textual, material form led readers and writers to reimagine the relationship between literary media and poetic meaning. Thus, they initiated a process of creative experimentation and a series of questions surrounding the interrelationship of technology and poetic expression that continue today in the print and digital age. Beginning with the shift from song traditions to book culture in the Greek world, our reading will then focus on several Roman books that take the medium in different directions: Catullus\u2019 \"little book,\" Virgil\u2019s Eclogues, Propertius\u2019 books of elegies, Horace\u2019s lyric Odes, Ovid\u2019s poetry of love and exile, and Statius\u2019 collection of Silvae. We will explore how the form and idea of the book intersect with ongoing literary conversations about monumentality and evanescence; performance, ritual and the archive; personhood and ventriloquism; defectiveness and beauty; and the poet\u2019s construction of a relationship with literary tradition and with readerships present and future.

The course, which mimics the design of a graduate seminar\u2014a single, two-and-a-half-hour meeting each week, focusing on in-depth discussion and textual explication, with a heavy emphasis on how to write critically about a literary text\u2014is designed to introduce first-year students to more profound and sophisticated techniques of reading and thinking about texts than they will have thus far encountered. After two prefatory sessions, in which students will be introduced to the large issues particular both to this genre (the archaic Greek world, oral composition, the Homeric Question) and to this particular text (the epic cycle, the \"heroic code,\" violence and warfare, the clash of civilizations, East vs. West, the role of the gods in human history), we will read through the epic at a rate of two books per week. Throughout, students will be introduced, by means of excerpts and shorter articles, to the arc of the scholarly tradition, especially with respect to the Homeric Question: from Wolf\u2019s Prolegomenon to Homer to M. L. West\u2019s recent argument that the Iliad was, in fact, written down by a single author/poet. Two summary sessions will conclude the semester as we (a) look at the classical heritage of the Iliad (the Aeneid, especially) and then (b) look back at the broad literary and cultural issues raised by this essential document of the Western tradition, and look at some modern adaptations (Logue\u2019s \"War Music,\" for instance; also attempts to dramatize the Iliad\u2014and why they so often fail). A premium will be placed on student participation in class discussion, and each student will be asked to present a book of the poem (focusing on structural analysis, interpretative issues, etc.) to the class. At least three papers, midterm, final exam. This course is designed for First-Year Students. Class size: 16",

Yet of course the field of American Indian fiction is in fact remarkably diverse in its tropes and its narrative forms. We will explore that diversity in texts written in English from the mid-nineteenth century to the early twenty-first. Certain concerns will recur, including population displacement, ecological disaster, the politics of religion, and the relationship between orality and print.

In the Republic, Socrates maintains that courage is one of the four virtues (or excellences) to be found in a good regime and in a good soul. Yet it is not entirely clear from his argument whether courage should be understood the same way in all contexts, and if so, how. Is a warrior\u2019s courage the same as that of a philosopher? Who is truly courageous, the one who defends the regime, the one who questions it, or both? Is the courage of Hektor or Achilles the same as that Socrates or Antigone? In this course, our discussion of courage will proceed through close readings of philosophical texts, both ancient and modern (Plato, Aristotle, Emerson, Tillich, Arendt) and imaginative representations in literature and film (Homer\u2019s Iliad, Sophocles\u2019 Antigone, Brecht\u2019s Mother Courage, Fugard\u2019sThe Island, Zinneman\u2019sHigh Noon, Bertolucci\u2019sThe Conformist). Among other things, we will be asking whether and in what way it makes sense to speak of a single virtue, courage, as being manifest in varying circumstances and in different times and places, and what we may mean today when we characterize a person or an act as courageous.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Experimental Humanities This course offers a foundation in media history and theory, with a focus on how to use aspects of traditional humanistic approaches such as close reading and visual literacy to critically engage with both traditional and new media. We will examine how new media interacts with and transforms culture by considering the emergence of digital media in relation to a prior moment of media shift with the explosion of print in eighteenth-century Europe. Exploring how writers and readers responded to the growing influence of print during what we now call the Enlightenment will provide a backdrop for discussing how new media has re-shaped our perception of time, space, publicity, knowledge, and identity. The premise of this course is that the new-ness of new media can only be approached against the background of humanistic experimentation and imagination with both old and new media. We will read eighteenth-century writers (Alexander Pope, Joseph Addison, and Charlotte Lennox), contemporary fiction writers (Doris Lessing and Neal Stephenson), and key media theorists (Walter Benjamin, Fredrick Kittler, Marshall McLuhan, Donna Haraway, and Katherine Hayles). As part of our ongoing examinations of how material conditions shape discourse, we will assess our own positions as users, consumers, and potential producers of media. This course fulfills a requirement for the Experimental Humanities concentration, and will involve a \"practice\" component that complements our engagement with media theory. Class size: 22",

What new forms and practices of reading and writing have emerged in this late age of typography? What is the nature, extent, and significance of these changes? This course re-assesses questions and themes long central to the study of literature including: archiving, authorship, canon formation, dissemination, materiality, narrative, poetics, and readership, among others. The course aims to understand our present moment in historical context by pairing contemporary works with texts from and about other shifts in media from the ancient world to the modern era. Readings include Flusser, Hayles, Borges, Eisenstein, Chartier, Danielewski, Plato, and Augustine, as well as works of HTML/hypertext fiction, Twitter literature, online poetry, fan fiction, and so on.

Throughout its history, Arthurian literature has been criticized for the effects it has upon its readers. The alternate world presented by these texts\u2014with their knights errant, beautiful princesses, marvelous animals, enchanted forests, and decentralized geography\u2014can seem more attractive than our own mundane world, and, in doing so, it is feared, can distract us from this world and our responsibilities within it. Over the semester, as we chart the birth and growth of Arthurian romance, we will be considering the uncertain moral status of this genre and its consequences for us today. Class size: 22",

        "description": "Cross-listed: Classical Studies; Experimental Humanities This course examines the invention of a phenomenon central to modern literary life: the poetry book. First adopted in the ancient Greek-speaking world and further developed among poets at Rome, the book and its textual, material form led readers and writers to reimagine the relationship between literary media and poetic meaning. Thus, they initiated a process of creative experimentation and a series of questions surrounding the interrelationship of technology and poetic expression that continue today in the print and digital age. Beginning with the shift from song traditions to book culture in the Greek world, our reading will then focus on several Roman books that take the medium in different directions: Catullus\u2019 \"little book,\" Virgil\u2019s Eclogues, Propertius\u2019 books of elegies, Horace\u2019s lyric Odes, Ovid\u2019s poetry of love and exile, and Statius\u2019 collection of Silvae. We will explore how the form and idea of the book intersect with ongoing literary conversations about monumentality and evanescence; performance, ritual and the archive; personhood and ventriloquism; defectiveness and beauty; and the poet\u2019s construction of a relationship with literary tradition and with readerships present and future. All readings will be in English. This course is a literature junior seminar. This course is part of the World Literature offering. Class size: 15",

The books we read, the tastes we acquire, and the ambitions we hold make us into insiders or outcasts, depending on where we stand. Do social structures inevitably reproduce themselves or can we ever hope to start over? Using literary and philosophical texts, this class will explore the tenuous process of passing from one condition to another. Whether this integrative process involves race, country, sexuality, gender, or socio-economics, it explodes the notion of a stable and unchanging self and focuses on border zones of culture and being. We will explore the threatening and liberating resonances of hybrid states and deterritorialized sensibility. Double-consciousness (W.E.B. Du Bois), double temporality (Spinoza), and double diaspora are some terms that will help us study the pain and loss involved in the plasticity of self, in the broken and rebuilt habits at the heart of our desire to be accepted.

This paradox generates some knotty questions of aesthetics, sensation, and media. Put them in the context of nineteenth- and twentieth-century American literature, and more arise. In what ways, for instance, does the representation of sound participate in the construction of race, region, and gender? And how do individual artists' approaches to writing sound respond to the development of new recording technologies? This seminar will explore these questions through works of scholarship in literary theory and sound studies; through adaptations that bring texts into other sonic media (phonograph, radio, film); and above all through written works whose expressive contours are shaped by the phenomenon of sound. Readings will likely include texts by Mikhail Bakhtin, Gwendolyn Brooks, George Washington Cable, Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, William Faulkner, Lisa Gitelman, Zora Neale Hurston, Tim Ingold, Helen Keller, Friedrich Kittler, Fred Moten, and Susan Stewart.

But, whether fact or fiction, we are regularly confronted by all sorts of signs, and we need to learn how to read the traces of things left behind at this or that scene, of a crime for instance. Matters of interpretation, presentation, even rhetoric arise immediately. Evidence, at a minimum, is presented for our deliberation and calls for us to make decisions, form conclusions, or reach judgments. Hence its legal meanings. On the basis of the traces of what has happened \u2014whether in the form of statistics, objects, images, or testimony\u2014we have to decide. This holds even or especially when the evidence seems least equivocal, as in the case of forensics. Sometimes what we see and read seems to compel action, while at other times it appears to immobilize us. As more and more of our world is exposed to view, what becomes of the would-be foundational character of evidence? What is it to ignore evidence? This seminar will explore the theory and practice of evidence, with special attention paid to the different forms evidence can take and the disputes to which it can give rise, especially when violations of, and claims for, human rights are at stake. Readings from Weschler, Felman, Krog, Ondatjie, Latour, Tamen, Azoulay, Didi-Huberman, Morrison, along with a lot of visual material. Class size: 16",

It will include famous polemics, such as Zola's J'Accuse, literary and arts criticism, and political reportage. Great critics, ranging from Cyril Connolly on literature to Lester Bangs on rock music, will be read. We will look at famous reportage, such as Mary McCarthy's pieces on Vietnam, and Alma Guillermoprieto on the killings in Mexico. H. L. Mencken's articles on the Monkey Trial of 1925 will be on the list, as will Hunter S. Thompson on the Hell's Angels. The fine (but important) line between factual reportage and fictional imagination will be explored in the work of Ryszard Kapuscinski and Curzio Malaparte. Students will be shown that journalism can be a literary genre. By reading some of the best, or most controversial practitioners, they will come to a better idea of what it is. Class size: 18",

A master of the aphorism, he believed condensation could penetrate rather than just abbreviate. In this course we will take up the challenge, and practice compression by writing prose that begins and ends on a single page. As poets have always known, brevity is a catalyst to invention. We will focus on the sentence, rather than the line, to investigate exactly how the syntax of narrative and description conveys the movement of thought. Among the short forms we will examine are early and post- modern prose sequences, micro-fictions, guide book entries, capsule reviews, the pr\u00e9cis, the Haibun, the parable, and notebook and journal entries. Among the writers included will be: John Ashbery, Samuel Becket, Thomas Bernhard, Lydia Davis, Russell Edson, Max Jacob, Franz Kafka, Daniil Kharms, Tan Lin, Harry Mathews, Harriett Mullen, Leslie Scalapino, the sinologist Edward Schafer, scent expert Luca Turin, Paul Valery, and Joe Wenderoth.

        "description": "The mainstream magazine or newspaper profile has a long history in English, one that dates back to Daniel Defoe\u2019s pioneering efforts, efforts that--significantly--ran in parallel to the emergence of the English novel. In this course, we will hopscotch through the history of the profile in English as we attempt to come to an understanding of how a written portrait of a real-live person--Defoe\u2019s profile of the criminal Jack Sheppard, for example--differs in nature and form from a written portrait of an invented person--such as Robinson Crusoe in Defoe\u2019s novel by that name. A writing workshop, this course will be focused, nonetheless, on reading. We will analyze how writers through time who have worked on deadline have managed the formally repetitive task of seizing facts about a person and forging them into a written portrait that offers a distant reader a fair--though sometimes unfair--picture of an individual human being. Readings will be drawn from the history of the practice of journalism of this kind, and will include texts by Defoe, De Quincey, Hazlitt, Rebecca West, George Orwell, Joan Didion, Gay Talese,Janet Malcolm,Henry Louis Gates, Katharine Boo, Jennifer Egan, David Foster Wallace, Leonard Michaels, James Wood, John Jeremiah Sullivan,Rachel Kaadzi Ghansahand others.Students wishing to enroll must contact instructor via email before registration.

Emphasis will be on demystifying the project process, including its bureaucratic hurdles, as well as exploring the role of research in the creative realm, and helping students use each other as a critical and inspirational resource during this protracted solitary endeavor, sharing works in progress when appropriate. This will supplement but never supplant the primary and sacrosanct role of the project adviser. Program faculty and alumni, career development and other staff, and outside speakers (such as editors, translators, MFA graduates and directors, publishing personnel, etc.) will all contribute their collective wisdom and experience, sharing the myriad ways in which writers move an idea toward full creative realization and giving a glimpse of the kinds of internships and careers available to the writer.

After two prefatory sessions, in which students will be introduced to the large issues particular both to this genre (the archaic Greek world, oral composition, the Homeric Question) and to this particular text (the epic cycle, the \"heroic code,\" violence and warfare, the clash of civilizations, East vs. West, the role of the gods in human history), we will read through the epic at a rate of two books per week. Throughout, students will be introduced, by means of excerpts and shorter articles, to the arc of the scholarly tradition, especially with respect to the Homeric Question: from Wolf\u2019s Prolegomenon to Homer to M. L. West\u2019s recent argument that the Iliad was, in fact, written down by a single author/poet. Two summary sessions will conclude the semester as we (a) look at the classical heritage of the Iliad (the Aeneid, especially) and then (b) look back at the broad literary and cultural issues raised by this essential document of the Western tradition, and look at some modern adaptations (Logue\u2019s \"War Music,\" for instance; also attempts to dramatize the Iliad\u2014and why they so often fail). A premium will be placed on student participation in class discussion, and each student will be asked to present a book of the poem (focusing on structural analysis, interpretative issues, etc.) to the class. At least three papers, midterm, final exam. This course is designed for First-Year Students. Class size: 16",

Athenian political, artistic, literary, and intellectual traditions continue to reverberate through the world today: democracy, tragedy and comedy, rhetoric, philosophy, history, as well as the classical style of sculpture and architecture stem from this remarkable culture. The course will confront some of the ambiguities and tensions (slavery, exclusion of women and non-citizens from political power), as well as the glories, of Athenian art, literature, and history during this period.

The first half of the semester will be devoted to the Classical epic: Iliad, Odyssey, Theogony, Argonautika, De Rerum Natura, Aeneid, Metamorphoses. The second half will trace the epic across the map of Europe: Beowulf (8th-10th c. CE), the Chanson de Roland (11th c.), the Niebelungenlied (13th c), the Divine Comedy (14th c) Orlando Furioso (16th c.), and Milton. Special attention will be paid to the long tradition of European epic as a vehicle for exploring tensions between European and non-European cultures. Most texts will be read in their entirety.

We will begin with Homer\u2019s Iliad and Odyssey, focusing particularly on the understanding of poetry manifest within the world of these poems. Readings from Greek literature will also include lyric poetry (focusing on Sappho and Pindar), and Attic drama (e.g., Aristophane\u2019s Frogs and Clouds, Aeschylus\u2019 Prometheus Bound, Euripides\u2019 Medea and Bacchae). Readings from the Latin corpus will include epic, lyric, and dramatic poetry (e.g. Vergil, Horace, Catullus, Seneca). Concurrently, we will be examining the ongoing critique of literature from the fragments of early Greek philosophers (e.g. Anaxagoras, Xenophanes, Heraclitus), through Plato and Aristotle, to Cicero and Horace. Our twofold aim will be to develop an understanding of all these texts in their original context and to consider how they set the stage for subsequent developments in western literature and criticism.

First adopted in the ancient Greek-speaking world and further developed among poets at Rome, the book and its textual, material form led readers and writers to reimagine the relationship between literary media and poetic meaning. Thus, they initiated a process of creative experimentation and a series of questions surrounding the interrelationship of technology and poetic expression that continue today in the print and digital age. Beginning with the shift from song traditions to book culture in the Greek world, our reading will then focus on several Roman books that take the medium in different directions: Catullus\u2019 \"little book,\" Virgil\u2019s Eclogues, Propertius\u2019 books of elegies, Horace\u2019s lyric Odes, Ovid\u2019s poetry of love and exile, and Statius\u2019 collection of Silvae. We will explore how the form and idea of the book intersect with ongoing literary conversations about monumentality and evanescence; performance, ritual and the archive; personhood and ventriloquism; defectiveness and beauty; and the poet\u2019s construction of a relationship with literary tradition and with readerships present and future.

This historical analysis will provide us with the groundwork for an in-depth reading of today's France and the many challenges it faces: crises of national identity in a postcolonial society, of the maintenance of a social model in the face of globalized economic competition, as well as, perhaps just as importantly, the crisis regarding the quality of the baguettes in one's local boulangerie. Aside from France's infamous pessimism, we will also focus on the seemingly positive aspects of French exceptionalism: the fromage, the fashion, the fact that the works of canonical French authors are bound in books resembling Bibles, and that a certain French president can create a scandal by expressing his dislike for a novel from the 17th century.

It will single out questions of ambition, snobbery, and exclusion through their vocabulary of flattery and contempt. We will examine the psychodynamics of prestige and acceptance, success and failure, as they are crystallized in the deeply antagonistic class relations from Stendhal's Julien Sorel to Eribon's Voyage \u00e0 Reims. We will examine the symbolic violence that marks social cleavages, dwell on Saint-Simon's utopian triad-- avoir/savoir/pouvoir\u2014and use as our model and anti-model the battle between Bourdieu's Habitus and Ranci\u00e8re's dissensus. Readings: Stendhal, Le Rouge et le noir (must be read before classes begin); Balzac, Le P\u00e8re Goriot and excerpts from Illusions perdues; Huysmans, A Rebours; Proust, Un Amour de Swann; Ernaux, La Place, Eribon, Retour \u00e0 Reims.

Students will meet ten hours a week (including a one-hour conversation class with the German language tutor). Outside of class, students will have the opportunity to connect and prepare for course work with innovative teaching and learning experiences online. The communicative approach actively involves students from day one in this class. As the course progresses, the transition is made from learning the language for everyday communication to the reading and discussion of classical and modern texts (such as Goethe, Heine, Kafka, Brecht) as well as of music and film. The concluding four weeks of the program will be spent at Bard\u2019s sister campus in Berlin: Students will further explore German language and culture in a twenty hours per week course, which is accompanied by guided tours introducing participants to Berlin\u2019s intriguing history, architecture, and vibrant cultural life. Students interested in this class must consult with Prof. Stephanie Kufner before on-line registration (Need-based financial aid for the Berlin section of the course is available; please discuss further details with instructor.)

The starting points of these explorations will be dateable events, such as January 1774 when Goethe establishes his literary fame after six somnambulant weeks of writing The Sorrows of Young Werther, or November 1949 when Hannah Arendt first revisits Germany after the Second World War. A date is the temporal center around which a singular work crystallizes. The constellation of dates this course creates will also reflect on pivotal (German) traditions of conceiving history itself (Nietzsche, Benjamin). Readings further include Kant's What is Enlightenment?, Goethe's Faust, B\u00fcchner's Danton\u2019s Death, Rosa Luxemburg's writing on revolution, as well as Hungerangel by the German Nobel Prize winner Herta M\u00fcller. The compendium A New History of German Literature (2004) will furnish apposite background reading. Taught in English. This course is part of the World Literature offering. Class size: 22",

Through a close reading of selected tales, with emphasis on language, plot, motif, and image, this course explores not only the tales\u2019 poetics and politics but also their origins in the oral tradition, in folklore and myth. The course considers major critical approaches (e.g., Freudian, Marxist, feminist) and conducts a contrastive analysis of creative adaptations (Disney, classical ballet, postmodern dance) and other fairy-tale traditions (Perrault, Straparola, Arabian Nights).

Readings will include works by Frank Wedekind, Gottfried Benn, Georg Heym, Else Lasker-Sch\u00fcler, Kafka, Georg Kaiser, and Georg Trakl. Since Expressionism involved not just literature but painting, music, and film, we will also consider works by the Br\u00fccke- and Blaue Reiter-associations of painters, Alban Berg\u2019s opera Wozzeck, and films such as Der letzte Mann, M, and Die B\u00fcchse der Pandora.

Unlike other European countries, there is no central stage in the construction of national culture that can boast hegemonic influence throughout Italian history. Although the myth of Rome and its imperial past fostered literati\u2019s dreams of political grandeur, Italy grounds its multifold identity on the difference and peculiarities of cities such as Florence, Venice, Naples and Milan. Living, walking, and imagining the city is a key experience for Italian culture, from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance, to the Postmodern.

Plants perform all the tasks we are familiar with from animal studies- acquiring energy, nutrients and water, growing and reproducing, sensing and responding to their environments- but the ways in which they do these tasks differ from animals. In this introductory course, we will examine the ways in which plants perform each of these tasks differently from animals. Topics include photosynthesis, cellular respiration, food webs, organism interactions and plant defenses. In the lab, you will explore the scientific process- reading and critiquing works by practicing scientists in the discipline to help you determine what is already known, asking questions, designing experiments, and reporting results. In the lab, you will perform field explorations of local ecosystems, explore antimicrobial properties of plant chemicals, and test hypotheses about plant-microbe interactions, and control of plant signaling and behavior.

The bulk of the course will be an examination of each of the major contemporary means of energy production (fossil fuels, nuclear, hydropower) and the emerging alternative means (wind, solar, biofuels). The course will seek to emphasize some of the subtleties behind energy production usually glossed over in popular discussion, and will rely heavily on developing students' abilities to perform 'back-of-the-envelope' calculations to estimate quantities of interest on a global scale.

In this seminar we will explore how cognitive and social psychology, as well as neuroscience, contribute to this conversation. We will consider how research on ordinary human tendencies can help us answer questions such as: Why are we more likely to mistakenly \"see\" a weapon in the hand of an African-American than a European-American? How and why does sentencing differ based on racial factors? How do deliberations differ based on a jury\u2019s racial composition? Broadly, we will grapple with how to reconcile legal doctrine that often demands evidence of conscious, deliberate intent to discriminate or harm with empirical data showing that behavior often operates outside of our awareness, and without intention or control. Although our focus will be primarily on issues of criminal law and law enforcement, we will cover topics such as voting rights and affirmative action as time and student interest provide.

This settlement began in 1710 as the first substantial German-speaking community in the New  World. Recent evidence indicates that Native Americans visited the minister\u2019s home (or Parsonage) before 1750, and that African Americans lived at the site by the early 1800s, if not decades earlier. The Mohicans likely came from their last village in New York, a German mission in the Taconic hills east of Bard. After a mass emigration from the Rhineland Palatinate and two years of forced labor conditions in Germantown, a robust economy began to grow in the central Hudson Valley around orchards and animal husbandry and has lasted almost three centuries. In the mid-1800s, several African American families established a neighborhood near the old village center and left traces of their own spiritual practices, possibly from their enslaved ancestors.

In the 1980s and 90s, as Japanese economic power and cultural influence grew worldwide, the nation's status as a global force was established beyond question. In more recent years, however, specters of economic recession, disenchanted youth, aging population, and nuclear disaster have produced new conditions of precarity, reconfiguring experiences and meanings of contemporary life. By focusing on such key transitions over the past seven decades, this course will offer an introduction to changing social, economic, and political formations in Japan from an anthropological perspective. Readings will include ethnographic works on economic recovery in the post-war period, gender in office politics, schools and disciplinary tactics, the culture of cuteness, delayed marriage and divorce, homelessness, and institutionalized care for the elderly. The final section of the course will explore transnational dimensions of Japan in a global context, including the aspirations of Japanese women abroad, and the globalization of popular culture genres such as anime.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Africana Studies; Global & International Studies; LAIS; Religion The many contemporary religions in Latin American and the Caribbean that draw upon African theology and practice testify to the vitality of the African heritage in the New World. The course examines these religions within their historical context as dimensions of the African diaspora and as they are currently practiced. We will be particularly concerned with issues of identity, empowerment, and appropriation. In this light will explore the religious and symbolic dimensions of these religions, from those that claim African orthodoxy to those that have embraced innovation and heterodoxy, and their sociopolitical structures. Issues concerning the race, class, gender, and politics of the leaders who guide these religions and the followers attracted to them will be examined in relation to the degree to which such affiliations may strengthen African identities and foster movements for cultural and racial political empowerment or may represent appropriations of the African heritage serving the interests of dominant groups. Throughout, the class will be attentive to the ways in which these religions are represented in ethnography and film. Religions examined include Candomble, Umbanda, and Batuque in Brazil; Santeria in Cuba and the Dominican Republic; Maria Lionza in Venezuela; Shango in Trinidad; and Vodun in Haiti. Class size: 20",

        "description": "Cross-listed: Environmental & Urban Studies; Global & International Studies; Human Rights; Midde Eastern Studies; Science, Technology, Society \"Culture\" has long been a key explanatory framework for scholars studying the modern Middle East. It has also been critical to the sorting, surveiling, managing and mobilizing techniques used by colonial and post-colonial regimes. Meanwhile nature, culture\u2019s doppleganger, has been quietly at work \"purifying\" the category of \"culture\" from the objects and processes assumed to be external to it. This course brings \"nature\" out of culture\u2019s shadows in order to examine how ideas about nature and the natural have shaped social scientific and historical scholarship on, and political and cultural formations within, the modern Middle East. We will investigate the relationship between nature and power in contexts of empire, decolonization and postcoloniality. Under the broad term \"nature\" we will consider such diverse topics as kinship, nationalism, violence, technology, war, race, gender, sexuality, environmentalism, fossil fuels and genetics. What role do genetics play in twenty-first century Middle East politics? How have practices of \"taming\" and managing nature and its resources shaped the parameters within which political authority\u2014and revolution\u2014can emerge? What can the study of the Middle East tell us about the extent to which homosexuality is a biological universal? What are the tensions between the idea of competing \"environmental imaginaries\" and theories that the nonhuman environment (e.g. rivers, dams, mosquitoes) has helped determine political, social and economic outcomes in the Middle East?

Drawing on ethnographic and historical readings from a number of disparate geographical locales (e.g. Japan, Ukraine, India, Palestine, South  Africa, Egypt, Nigeria, France, Venezuela, the United States, the United Arab Emirates) we will start by asking when, and with what consequences, infrastructures become visible or invisible. The course will be organized thematically around different types of infrastructure present in modern colonial and postcolonial contexts. These will include roads, water distribution networks, landfills, sewage pipelines, electricity, telecommunications, nuclear energy stations and mass media forms such as radio and television. We will explore how infrastructures become central to popular claims to rights, how they shape senses and sensibilities and how they shape relationships between the body and the public (the \"body politic\"). We will investigate how marginalized groups may reappropriate dominant infrastructures, for example, such that the \"messages\" infrastructures convey and the material effects they produce may be transformed. Climate change scientists increasingly have the ear of governments and multinational corporations. We will thus also consider how climate change \"adaptation\" and emissions reductions strategies through new large-scale infrastructures are producing new discourses around environmental security and new ways of imagining the future of human existence. This class will include engagement with local and regional communities and will include joint classroom and field experiences with Prof. Ellen Driscoll's ART206 Sculpture II: Fluid Dynamics class and Prof. Elias Dueker\u2019s EUS 316 Waste class.

How do surveillance practices secure or undermine state sovereignty and citizen solidarity in a digital age? This course will look at a variety of surveillance techniques, ranging from low-tech forms of social surveillance to state and corporate surveillance in visual, audio, and digital forms. Drawing on ethnographic, artistic, and theoretical works, we will consider the importance of visual media to enhance state or corporate power/knowledge over citizens and workers. We will also study the uses of sound technology for surveillance purposes, from Anathasius Kircher\u2019s 17th century listening tubes to 20th century telephone wiretapping (a metaphor now used to also describe monitoring digital data). Acoustic surveillance intervenes in human beings\u2019 most primary form of social communication - talking and listening \u2013 and draws our attention to the ways that social groups monitor themselves through practices like gossip and rumor. Surveillance is therefore not only related to the power of corporations or governments, but also gets at the heart of what it means to be social beings who constantly monitor each other and ourselves with or without technology. The course will traverse practices of surveillance in different parts of the globe and from both sides of the \"digital divide\" - from informal informants who spy on fellow refugees in Italy, to police surveillance in Gaza, to hacker groups like Anonymous or Wikileaks, or Snowden's exposure of the NSA, to more public citizen campaigns like #wearewatchingyou that also target state surveillance practices. As a student-generated Experimental Humanities course, this class will require significant participation on the part of the students to research a specific surveillance practice over the course of the semester and design their own experimental projects based around their research and our readings.

Practices of both collection and display have been central to the imagining and valuing of various kinds of cultural others, and to the construction and communication of knowledge about the world\u2019s peoples. This course will examine multiple historical and theoretical points of articulation (and disarticulation) between the museum and the discipline of anthropology. Topics include: the place of the \"exotic\" curio in early European and colonial collections; the rise of natural history and social evolutionary paradigms for exhibiting non-Western objects and people; the development of professional anthropology in the museum; popular forms of ethno-spectacle (e.g. the world\u2019s fair, cinema, and commercial culture) and the lasting tension between education and entertainment; debates surrounding \"primitivism\" and avant-garde interest in non-Western art; nationalism, sovereignty, and repatriation in the wake of decolonization; and contemporary anthropological and ethnographic studies of museums as sites of cultural production and contest. Through critical readings, discussions, and a visit to museums in New York City, students will come to better understand and appreciate the dynamics of collecting, studying, and displaying the art and material culture of the world\u2019s peoples.

What role do these perceptions play in the framing of immigration policy? Is there a case for immigration policy reform, both generally and with respect to illegal migration?

This course addresses these questions by exploring a range of revolutions in Europe and Asia during the past five centuries. A primary focus of the course will center on analyzing and comparing some of the most iconic and influential revolutions in world history: the French Revolution of 1789, the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, and the Chinese Communist Revolution of 1921-1949. In addition, we will analyze the causes and impact of a range of other revolutionary moments, including the German Peasant Revolt of 1525, the Taiping Rebellion, the Meiji Restoration, the 1905 Revolution in Russia, the 1911 Revolution in China, China's Cultural Revolution, the protests by students and intellectuals that rocked continental Europe in 1968, and the \"velvet revolutions\" and near revolutions that transformed state socialism in 1989. As we compare revolutions over time, we will try to discern links or lines of influence between revolutionary movements. We will also explore how particular revolutionary movements contributed to a shared repertoire of revolutionary thought and action. No previous study of history is necessary for this course; first-year students are welcome. Class size: 35",

In this course, we will examine how different experiments and artisanal practices have been used to interpret the natural world, and how those interpretations are reflective of the time periods and cultural contexts in which they were made. We will conduct our own experiments in replicability, discuss performance and the public culture of science, and explore the visual and material cultures of science.

The course emphasizes the interaction between society, culture and politics. Therefore, in addressing each of these broad themes, it pays particular attention to their social and cultural aspects such as, gender, labor, popular culture and forms of protest. The geographic focus of the course is largely the Eastern Mediterranean (including Egypt and Turkey), Iran and, to a lesser extent, the Gulf. While emphasizing the history of the modern Middle East, the course is meant to help students acquire critical tools necessary for the study of history more generally.

It focuses largely on France, Britain, and America. However, students will be encouraged to think comparatively and globally. We will consider the development of the police as an expression of sovereign right and of citizens\u2019 rights, from enforcer of the king\u2019s will to public servant. Changing ideas of security and order not only undergird the history of the police but have developed through police practices. We will observe how resistance to diverse forms of policing entered into civil and human rights discourses almost from the start. The course is organized chronologically and around public space: the market, food security, and price regulation; the port and contraband; the urban street, vice, and violence; the road, highwaymen, and runaway slaves; the public housing project and domestic violence; the neighborhood and resistance to policing; and from the more abstract sites of early international cooperation to state and international investigative agencies, such as the FBI, MI 6, and Interpol. In these spaces, we study the vulnerabilities of individual bodies and social groups, including those of the police. We study vulnerabilities that resulted from the institutional growth of the police, especially in its powers to identify, classify, and contain mobile populations and commit acts of violence with legitimacy. Today, many police departments include \"courage\" in their mission statements, accepting that the job requires their members throw themselves bodily into high-risk situations. Members of marked populations describe as \"courageous\" activities that unmarked populations take as commonplace or as their right, from walking in a different neighborhood to raising children. Beyond bold acts in the service of order or outstanding acts of opposition, we will consider how the policed world incited and incites everyday forms of courage, contributing to ideas of citizenship and personhood.

Numerous studies correlate dams with reduced salmon spawning, reservoirs with more rapid evaporation of water, and pesticides with extinctions and mutations.

        "description": "Cross-listed: American Studies; Experimental Humanities; Historical Studies Societies in different historical periods have habitually used performance to stage, reinforce, and re-imagine the scope of political and colonial power. The history of the theater, therefore, is inextricably connected with the history of how societies have performed conquest, colonialism, and cultural patrimony in different parts of the world. This interdisciplinary course, covering performance and power of the early modern period, will disrupt habitual assumptions about both the disciplines of theater and history. Students will read baroque plays, study their historical contexts, and experiment with staging scenes, to uncover the links between imagined and actual Atlantic expansion and the impact of colonialism, 1492-1825. Artistic forms to be examined include the English court masque, the Spanish auto sacramental, and spectacles of power and conversion staged in the colonial Americas; plays will range from Shakespeare's The Tempest to Marivaux's The Island of Slaves to allegorical works by Calderon, Lope de Vega, Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz, and more.

We will explore the literary expressions of Greek religion (the connection between myth and religion, e.g.), and the ways in which Greek religious beliefs and practices profoundly affected the development of Greek culture and history, in particular in the classical city state of Athens, and also in the syncretistic Hellenistic world that came afterwards.

But rapid development also had steep environmental costs. This class explores the similarities and differences in the ways that each country has approached the environment, from historical themes in the culture, society, and religion of each place, to more modern domestic and international concerns over pollution, waste, energy and food security, population growth, resource degradation, public health, and social justice. We will explore both how the region's strong states have confronted environmental crises and how social movements have created openings for environmental law and policy along with a more vibrant civil society in all three countries, despite post-World War II histories of an entrenched political class resisting popular opposition.

        "description": "Cross-listed: Human Rights; Midde Eastern Studies In the United States, \"the antebellum Cotton\nKingdom\" shapes understandings of slavery and its legacy. As powerful and widespread as these experiences were, the global history of slavery is broader. The trans-Atlantic slave trade was not alone in the early modern period. Millions of Africans were enslaved and forced to covert to Islam in an eastern-oriented trade, alongside Slavs and Caucasians. Their experiences ran the gamut of alienated labor up to occupying the most prestigious positions within the imperial army and administration of the Ottoman Empire, the longest lasting Islamic empire in history (ca.1300-1922). Taking the experiences of Ottoman slaves as a starting point, this seminar explores the identities, trajectories and afterlives of slaves in the Middle East (very broadly defined to include North Africa, the Balkans and the Caucasus) during the early modern and modern periods. The seminar's main topics include: the recruitment, training and careers of slaves; the everyday life of slaves; the trade networks that enabled the displacement of slaves; the paradoxical role of European colonialism in ending slavery; the memory of slavery and its influence on postcolonial societies; and the reemergence of new forms of slavery in today's Middle East.

Shifting competitions of world and regional powers have been a factor at every turn (Ottoman, British, American/Soviet, hegemonic American and Iranian). Finally, we will also assess the changing nature of international opinion and support: Israel\u2019s image, the prospects of recent international (often non-governmental) movements to influence Israeli policy, the evolving relationship between American Jews and Israel and alternative possible solutions to the conflict.

This course explores the hidden life of material objects that circulated from the early modern Atlantic into the rest of the world. The life cycle of these products and items reveal narratives of Atlantic violence imbedded into these products: the claiming of Indian land, the theft of enslaved labor, the construction and corruption of gender norms. Course readings will introduce historical methods and strategies to reclaim history from objects found in different parts of the Americas and will culminate with students having the opportunity to do original research and write the narrative of an item themselves.

We will begin with a discussion of the figure of Socrates, the paradigmatic ancient philosopher, including his disavowal of knowledge, his method of dialogue, his public trial, and his exemplary death. The second part of the course will focus on the two most significant thinkers in the classical period of philosophy, Plato and Aristotle, and on close examination of their philosophical arguments about the nature of knowledge, the powers of the soul, and the highest goal of life. We will conclude with a discussion of the profound critiques of classical philosophy developed by the major philosophical schools in post-classical Greece and Rome, including Cynicism, Epicureanism, Stoicism, and Skepticism.

An ancient tradition claims that we have a detailed set of inborn capabilities and limitations, rich in implications for how we can live our lives and organize society. An opposing tradition emphasizes plasticity and indeterminacy; at the limit, it pictures us as \"blank slates,\" ready to form ourselves or to be formed by society. What remains of this debate once we refine the claims of each side? If there is a human nature, what is it, who can speak with authority about it, and what implications does it have for changing what we are? If there isn\u2019t a human nature, does this more freely license the genetic and technological development of what we are? We will investigate these and other questions in the course through an interdisciplinary mix of readings from philosophy, psychology, evolutionary biology, and other fields. Class size: 22",

In modern times, however, this ancient view of the state has come to seem doubtful and even dangerous. For many modern thinkers \u2013 beginning with Thomas Hobbes in the seventeenth century \u2013 the state is anything but natural. It is at best a useful artifice designed to keep the peace among naturally conflicting interests, and at worst a monstrous fraud whereby those in power oppress their subjects in the name of the \"common good\". This difference between ancient and modern views of the state has profound implications for a series of fundamental questions in political theory: what is a political community? How can political authority be legitimate? Is disobedience or revolution against the existing authorities ever justified? If so, when? This course introduces students to the philosophical tradition of reflection on these questions through reading, discussing, and writing about classic works of political theory from antiquity to the present. The course is designed for sophomores and juniors who want to deepen their interest in political philosophy and to reflect on the foundations of their own political engagement. In addition to Aristotle and Hobbes, our primary readings will come from Jean-Jacques Rousseau, John Stuart Mill, and John Rawls. First-year students may apply. Class size: 22",

The result is typically a mechanistic and reductive picture of the mind, one on which the mind is just one arena among many in which causal factors operate to produce effects. However, some philosophers question whether a mechanistic picture of the mind can adequately accommodate our first person perspective, that is, what it feels like from the inside to have a mind and navigate the world with it. In this course, we will address the question of whether mechanistic accounts of the mind can accommodate our first person perspective by focusing on three main topics: the qualitative or phenomenological dimension of experience; our knowledge of our own attitudes; and our engagement in mental action.

We follow the thread to the most celebrated diagonal results, G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness theorems of 1931, and then on to the establishment of formal semantics in Alfred Tarski\u2019s paper of 1933, \"The Concept of Truth in Formalized Languages.\" The story has held the attention of philosophers since Bertrand Russell showed in 1901 that diagonalization has dangerous relatives: the paradoxes of logic and semantics.

The original edition of the Gay Science ends with a passage that is word for word the opening of the Prologue of Zarathustra, and then after Nietzsche finishes Zarathustra, he turns to add a final book to The Gay Science. Thus the two texts, so different in style, tone, and narrative arc, are not only in conversation with each other but literally open up into each other. We will pay close attention to such themes as perspectivism, literary experimentalism, philosophy (and life) as art, the diagnosis of modernity as cultural nihilism, the recovery of the body, the central role of the unconscious, and the concepts of the will to power, the revaluation of values, the overman, and the death of god.

The course will review the ideas of a few major thinkers such as Adam Smith, Karl Marx, Karl Polanyi, Thorstein Veblen, John Maynard Keynes, and John Kenneth Galbraith, and will introduce students to two subfields in particular: international political economy and the political economy of development. Among the questions we would ask are: Why are some countries rich and others poor? What is development? What are the prime movers of globalization? Is the US an empire given its influence and power in the global economy? How can development be redefined to tackle the challenge of climate change? Among issues that we will look at closely is the role of organizations such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the World Trade Organization in managing the global economy and the current debates about reforming these institutions.

        "department": "politicalstudies",
        "description": "Cross-listed: Literature Since the development of mass culture, political and aesthetic thinkers have questioned how it is possible for us to be part of massive institutional structures such as state bureaucracy, the market, and education without compromising what it means to be a self. In order to be someone, we might wager, we must be both separate and together, participate in recognizing others and recede from the world in solitude. Yet today, subjectivity appears to pertain to what we buy rather than to who we are as personalities. Personal conviction can thus be immobilized by an overwhelming feeling of uncertainty: Who am I? What do I stand for and why does it matter? At the same time, such insecurities may be employed to fuel the political and literary imagination and envision new ways of being in the world. This course will turn to writers including Franz Kafka, Albert Camus, Walter Benjamin, Jean Am\u00e9ry, and Hannah Arendt to explore different answers to the question of selfhood as both an ethical and aesthetic problem in a mass society. After considering some of the theoretical foundations of modern subjectivity, we will investigate what emerges as (or remains of) selfhood after the large-scale degradation of human beings in the two world wars. The course will ask how writers and thinkers reconceive of the idea of subjectivity precisely through its crisis. As examples, we will look at some paradigmatic \"lost\" subjects of the postwar period such as Kafka\u2019s protagonists, the \"schizophrenic\" child (Bruno Bettelheim), and the disenchanted stranger (Camus). This course is part of the College Seminar \"The Courage to Be.\" It is open to Sophomores and Juniors and is limited to 16 students. Students are required to attend three evening lectures on Mondays from 6-8. There will also be dinner discussions with guest speakers and students from other sections of the College Seminar.

We will begin by examining the interdisciplinary literature on gender theory and applying its insights to international politics. What does it mean to conduct a \"gendered analysis\" of global affairs? How do gendered discourses produce our understanding of what is and is not understood as a national security problem? Why has traditional security studies failed to incorporate gender into its analysis? Then, we apply these theoretical frameworks to important security issues such as,the cultural effects of nuclear weapons, the targeting of civilians during armed conflict, sexual violence in war, torture and the war on terrorism, nationalism and the state, human security and development, and post-conflict societies, to name a few. Throughout, the gendered nature of security issues will be explored from multi-disciplinary perspectives drawn from anthropology, sociology, philosophy, politics and rhetoric in order to highlight the complex interconnections among states, societies and individuals. Historical and contemporary case studies will be drawn from a number of countries across the globe. In reexamining key concepts in the study of international politics\u2014namely, sovereignty, the state and insecurity\u2014this course has two goals. First, to expose how gendered discourses of security that focus on the state render invisible a multitude of threats to individual security. Second, to question the role of the state as a security provider by highlighting the insecurities individuals and societies experience as a consequence of state-centered national security policy.

The course is divided into three main sections. The first one covers the years between 1830-1940, and emphasizes American attempts to establish economic hegemony across Latin America and military interventions designed to export democratic government and Latin American responses to what was perceived as an imperial and/or colonial American project. The second section focuses on the dynamics of the Cold War as played out throughout Latin America between the years of 1940-1990. It emphasizes the real and perceived fears by US policy-makers about the advent of Marxist-inspired revolutions in Latin America, which led to several interventions and covert actions; and the high toll that the Cold War exacted upon Latin America. The third and final section looks at the most salient issues in US-Latin American relations in the post-Cold War years, especially economic integration, narco-trafficking, immigration, and the war on terror.

Does the need to intervene to stop human rights violations outweigh the right of states to maintain control over territory? The international states system is built upon the principles of sovereignty and nonintervention. Yet over the past two decades human rights have emerged as an increasingly accepted justification legitimizing the use of force. This apparent tension between the respect for state sovereignty and the inevitable violations that result from the use of military force for humanitarian purposes is at the center of the debate over human rights in the field of international relations. This course explores the dilemmas and controversies surrounding the use of force for humanitarian purposes. The first part examines the major ethical, political and strategic arguments for and against humanitarian military intervention. The second part focuses on specific instances where states undertook, or failed to undertake, a humanitarian military intervention (for example, Bosnia, Somalia, Rwanda, Kosovo, Sudan, Libya and Syria, among others). Through an examination of particular case studies, we will better understand why the international community has such an inconsistent record of stopping humanitarian crises and what the limitations and possibilities of human rights are in international politics.

They will then examine the evolution of those components and contexts to include public diplomacy, cyber diplomacy, diplomacy in combat zones and the use of international development as a foreign policy tool. Using selected diplomatic crises as case studies, students will analyze the roles played by different government agencies, militaries, international & regional organizations, the media, public interest groups, private foundations, contractors, commercial interests, educational institutions, and law enforcement officials. Students will explore how nations communicate with each other in the 21st century (formally and informally) and will use in-class simulations and videoconferences with students across the Bard international network to explore the roles played by different actors in addressing immediate crises and longer-term diplomatic issues.

But rapid development also had steep environmental costs. This class explores the similarities and differences in the ways that each country has approached the environment, from historical themes in the culture, society, and religion of each place, to more modern domestic and international concerns over pollution, waste, energy and food security, population growth, resource degradation, public health, and social justice. We will explore both how the region's strong states have confronted environmental crises and how social movements have created openings for environmental law and policy along with a more vibrant civil society in all three countries, despite post-World War II histories of an entrenched political class resisting popular opposition.

We are facing in the United States and around the world a radical loss of political legitimacy. It is periods like these when political power is diminished that the possibility of new political systems has emerged. These are revolutionary times. But what is a revolution? And what makes a successful revolution? At root, a revolution requires revolutionaries, those who not only courageously risk their lives but also have the courage to think new thoughts and dream new dreams. But something more is required. According to Hannah Arendt, successful revolutions constitute freedom. It is not surprising that in her book \"On Revolution\" Arendt has two long chapters on the American Constitution. This short course (2 credits) asks the question, what is the role of the American Constitution in the American Revolution. Our principle text will be Hannah Arendt\u2019s book \"On Revolution\" and we will focus on the Constitutional aspects of Arendt\u2019s argument. We will meet for four sessions in February and for two additional sessions in April. In between, in March, students will do research and write drafts of papers on the historical or philosophical background of Arendt\u2019s text. Final papers will then be revised and submitted by the end of April. Class size:\n16",

The first generation of scholarsviewed the process somewhat optimistically as the global extension ofmodernity. Neo-Marxist critics tried to locate Third Worldunderdevelopment in the history of colonialism and in the persistenceof structures of dependency of Third  World countries. \"Post-development\" theorists took on the idea of development itself. Globalization and the emergence of a new international division oflabor, has reframed the debates. Developing countries like Argentina,Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico and South Africa are nowmembers of the G-20 group of countries, which many see as a likelysuccessor to the G8 group of leading industrial economies.

The songs, legends, and theologies of these saints and the communities they established permeate the religious life of India. This course explores the world of bhakti through its poetry. We examine issues of poetics and theology, bhakti and opposition to orthodox social conventions, bhakti and gender, the interactions of Hindu devotionalism and Islamic Sufism, the role of bhakti in Indian music, and the problem of bhakti in twentieth-century Indian literature. This is a writing intensive course.

And except for those forms of Buddhism that continued in northern India before finally disappearing around the thirteenth century, all Buddhist communities have been separated from the geographical origin of Buddhism by space. In this course we will look at how Buddhist communities have attempted to bridge this gap between themselves and the origin of their tradition by examining Buddhist conceptions of history, on the one hand, and Buddhist visions of the geographical layout of the Buddhist world, on the other. We will focus on Buddhist historiographical works and legends to better understand Buddhist historical thought, while early Buddhist maps will aid us in understanding how certain Buddhist communities understood their geographical positions vis-\u00e0-vis other communities, real or imagined. For purposes of comparison we will also be reading about historical and geographical thought as found in other religious traditions. Class size: 17",

        "department": "socstudies",
        "description": "Cross-listed: Human Rights; Psychology It has now been more than fifty years since the original work of Stanley Milgram demonstrated the remarkable and very widely unpredicted finding that large numbers of individuals in multiple samples of American men and women studied were willing to \"punish\" another person when ordered to do so by an experimenter; this in the stated but false context of a psychology experiment on learning and memory. The prominence of the initial work and the continued salience of such study and accumulated findings in the domain of social psychology cannot be over-stated. And it very much has not reached the stage of dormancy as the publication of studies, reviews and conferences on the topic of obedience to authority continue to appear in unabated fashion. It is even the case that as recently as six years ago a replication of the original study, with only slight modifications, and with concordant resultswas published (J. Burger, January 2009). Further revealing of prominence and remarkable is that fact that a new full-length movie version of the original study (a biopic) is about to be released. In addition, a diligentsearch of current psychology or cross disciplinary archives uncovers further studies that provide evidence that obedienceand indeed destructive obedience is very much prevalent in our society and in many others as well and in a myriad of contexts. The domain of the \"Milgram study\" is especially worthy of continuing interest. This because of the vastness of both criticism and praise of the original work but also because of historical and significant events in the intervening years between 1960sandstretching to our current time. The continuing study of obedience is vital for the betterment of institutions, even in a democratic society. Social scientists should and must find a way to safely and ethically investigate the conditions that promote destructive obedience and thereby begin to learn the rudiments of how such can be minimized. This is a college seminar. It is not limited to psychology or social studies or for that matter majors in any particular discipline. The two criteria for membership are a willingness to read with care and then with conviction share with others the results of such reading and study. Over the course of the semester a sizable portion of the work contained in the body of the obedience literature is reviewed. Admission by permission of the instructor. Class size 10 \u2013 12.",

At its most basic, the course will teach students how to read social science texts and evaluate their arguments. Conceptually, students will learn basic sociological themes and become familiar with how sociologists ask and answer questions.

What are the sources of this inequality? Is social inequality inevitable? Is it undesirable? Through lectures, documentary films and class discussions, this course examines the ways by which socially-defined class, gender, race and ethnic categories are unevenly rewarded for their social contributions. Sociological theories are used to explain how and why social inequality is produced and maintained, and how it affects the well-being of individuals and social groups. The course will focus on two general themes. The first deals with the structure of inequality while studying the unequal distribution of material and social resources (e.g., social status, wealth, power). The second examines the processes that determine the allocation of people to positions in the stratification system (e.g. educational attainment, social capital, parental wealth, institutional discrimination).

The course is organized according to different institutional and interactional contexts, including families, workplaces, schools, the state & politics, sexuality, culture, and identity.Our discussions will be guided by both theoretical approaches to gender and a variety of empirical research. A second goal of this course is to become familiar with various sociological theories of gender difference and inequality. A third goal is to learn how gender inequality is intertwined with other axes of power such as race/ethnicity, class, and sexuality and how to conduct such \"intersectional\" analysis of social life.

The course is divided into two parts. In the first, we will learn how to formulate research questions and hypotheses, how to choose the appropriate research method for the problem, and how to maximize chances for valid and reliable findings. In the second part, we will learn how to perform simple data analysis and how to interpret and present findings in a written report. For a final paper, students use data from the U.S. General Social Survey (GSS) to study public attitudes toward issues such as abortion, immigration, inequality and welfare, affirmative action, gender roles, religion, the media, and gun laws. By the end of the semester, students will have the necessary skills for designing and conducting independent research for term papers and senior projects, as well as for non-academic enterprises.

We then follow these conversations into the contemporary era, examining traditions such as functionalism, conflict theory, rational choice, symbolic interactionism, feminist theory, and critical theory, including thinkers such as G.H. Mead, Robert Merton, Pierre Bourdieu, J\u00fcrgen Habermas, and Michel Foucault.

The amount and type of punishment found in society is not a simple, direct result of crime patterns. Rather, to understand how and why we punish, we must examine the ways that historical processes, social structures, institutions, and culture shape penal practices as well as how systems of punishment shape society. This course draws on sociological and historical research to explore the social functions of punishment, its cultural foundations and meanings, what drives changes in how we punish, the relationship between penal practices and state power, and the role of crime control in reproducing race, gender, and class inequality. The class also delves deeply into the theoretical and empirical debates about the punitive turn in American criminal justice over the last 4 decades. We consider the causes and consequences of mass incarceration, the racial disparities in the system, the drug war, changes in policing, the politicization of crime, and the role of criminal justice in the welfare state.

This course uses examples such as food systems, fracking, health disparities, and natural disasters to critically assess the relationship between society and the environment at local and global scales. In doing so, we cover four topics that are central to environmental sociology. First, the course explores how people collectively understand and frame environmental issues. Second, we examine how social structures, political and economic institutions, and individual human actions shape and disrupt the natural environment. Third, we analyze the social consequences of a changing natural world, focusing on the unequal distribution of the benefits and burdens of environmental change. Finally, students will critically examine the ways that scholars, policymakers, and citizens are responding to the many contemporary environmental challenges. Class size: 22",

This will help us to see how classical sociological thinkers \u2013 especially Marx, Weber, and Durkheim \u2013 drew on legal concepts and traditions in formulating their theories of social order (and disorder). Shifting from a historical perspective to a more holistic and contemporary perspective, we will study the myriad ways in which law is impacting, and is impacted by, the social forces of the modern world. We will focus especially on the role that law plays in making modern, industrialized capitalism possible.

Taken together, these two groups today comprise between a fifth and a quarter of all Americans. Although they have had very different histories, it is common to think that both groups are especially concentrated in the bottom rungs of socio-economic wellbeing. And we will consider what life at the bottom rungs means in each group. But we will spend more than half the course exploring the experiences of those in each group who live above the lowest socio-economic rungs. How large a fraction are these more fortunate families in each group? How secure are they in their distance from poverty? What can we say about where they live, how they work, their education, lifestyles? Of special interest will be the prevalence (high or low) of inter-racial and inter-ethnic families; this can be a telling indicator of how separate a group is from the rest of society. Throughout, we will try to keep in mind three kinds of comparisons: African-American to Mexican American, higher to lower class within each group, and comparisons of each group to the Euro-American (\u2018white\u2019) Americans.

The course considers the relationship between gender and definitions of what is normal, sick, and criminal and investigates how norms about masculinity and femininity can produce specifically gendered types of deviance. We will learn about the role of gender in why and how people break rules, looking at both criminal and non-criminal deviance. We will then explore how social institutions construct and enact forms of regulation, punishment, or treatment. The course asks how responses to rule-breaking relate to the social organization of gender and sexuality. To help answer these questions, the course will continually ask how these processes intersect with race and class inequality. The course looks at both formal and informal responses to deviance, and considers their role in gender, class, and race inequality more broadly. The last half of the course examines major areas of gendered deviance, such as sex work, sexual violence, and the medicalization of deviance. Throughout, the course considers the ways that gendered social control both limits and creates possibilities for action and how individuals use gender to make rule-breaking meaningful.

        "department": "bgia",
        "description": "This course provides a general overview of determinants of health in the developing world and principles within the field of global public health. It will include a review of some current and historical public health problems, such as tuberculosis, malaria, AIDS, small pox, maternal and infant mortality and reproductive health and rights, and the approaches used to understand and address them. Students will also examine the roles of a range of international organizations involved in global public health efforts, including local and international non-governmental organizations, multilateral agencies such as the WHO, UNAIDS, bilateral organizations like the CDC and USAID, governments and donor organizations. The course aims to convey an understanding of the complexity of health problems in developing countries, the impact of health on social and economic development, the contributions of various disciplines and analytical perspectives in decision-making about public health priorities, and the range of players that contribute to developing and implementing the programs to address them. The course will be structured primarily around a series of case studies of public health policies and practices around which there has been controversy or debate about the appropriate course of action. The case studies will include a major focus on HIV/AIDS and sexual and reproductive health, and will examine such issues as quarantine, testing of new technologies on vulnerable populations, commitment of resources to treatment versus prevention, and the influence of conflicting \"moralities\" on public health program approaches. These debates will examine the tensions that sometimes arise between efforts to ensure public health and safety, while promoting health equity and rights. It will incorporate perspectives of stakeholders in the developing world, as well as scientists, policy makers and activists. The analysis and readings will draw from various disciplines, including epidemiology and medical anthropology. Class size: 15",

        "department": "bgia",
        "description": "This course is about the relationship between information, analysis, risk and decision makers. On one level, this means that it is about something you do yourself all the time -- but we will be looking specifically at how analysis is produced for those who work in both the public and the private sectors and face critical political, investment, or even humanitarian decisions. Concentrating on three crucial components \u2013 collection, analysis and communications \u2013 the goal is understand processes behind the production of good analysis and the ways in which it can be conveyed to decision makers. At the same time as intensively studying some of the instances in which intelligence analysis has resulted in success -- and, because it tends to be more revealing, those where it has not -- we will be trying out some of the techniques involved in professional analysis, including writing, presentations, and team work, and looking at analysts working in the government, financial, and non-profit sectors. The intention is to offer an appreciation of what professional analysts do in an intelligence and political risk context, and how their work can feed into the conduct of international relations and international business. Major topics include the Iranian Revolution, the Iraq War, and the development of the American space program in the context of the Cold War. Class size: 15",

        "department": "bgia",
        "description": "In this course we will examine ways in which foreign correspondents cover the world. We will learn about how journalism interrogates human rights, conflict, economic development, climate change, culture, and current events generally. We will explore the social, economic, and political fissures impacting the coverage of global affairs. And we will discuss the changing media landscape such as the rise of social media, the perspectives of journalism from different parts of the world, and how the media influence international relations. We will acquire an understanding of the issues animating current media coverage of global affairs, and also will learn about the mechanics of journalism, such as editing, contextualizing subject matter, and fundamental reporting skills. Although we will scrutinize video, radio, and multimedia journalism, this course primarily seeks to sharpen your understanding of and ability at expository writing on global affairs and you will be expected to write intensively almost every week.Class assignments will entail research and original reporting. We will read and discuss a representative sampling of articles and books by journalists about foreign affairs, and will include discussions with experienced reporters and editors about their work.
